VLM Prompt:
Image1:

Image2:
<image>
Image3:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a clean tomato in garbagecan."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a sink or a basin, clean the object with a sink or basin, and then find the correct location to place it and put it down there. The agent does not need to use soap bottle or faucet to clean the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "clean the object with the sink or sink basin"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a clean tomato in garbagecan"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see countertop (1-2), cabinet (1-11), garbagecan (1), toaster (1), sinkbasin (1), fridge (1), sink (1), microwave (1), drawer (1-3), stoveburner (1-4), coffeemachine (1), diningtable (1)

(20): go to stoveburner 4
(21): go to coffeemachine 1
(22): go to cabinet 9
(23): go to cabinet 10
(24): go to cabinet 11

**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.

Original Response:
First, we need to identify if there is a tomato visible in the images provided. In Image 1, we can see a countertop with a toaster and a sink. In Image 2 and Image 3, which are identical, we see the inside of a fridge with bread and a cup. There is no tomato visible in any of the images.

Since there is no tomato visible, we must search every place based on the Initial Observation to find the object. The most logical location to find a tomato would be either the fridge or a cabinet where fresh produce might be stored. Given the task description "put a clean tomato in garbagecan," we would first need to find a tomato.

The fridge has been shown in images, but it's not fully examined, so we should check there first. The answer is: (32): examine fridge 1.
