VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
Image2:
<image>
Image3:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a clean tomato in garbagecan."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a sink or a basin, clean the object with a sink or basin, and then find the correct location to place it and put it down there. The agent does not need to use soap bottle or faucet to clean the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "clean the object with the sink or sink basin"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a clean tomato in garbagecan"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see countertop (1-2), cabinet (1-11), garbagecan (1), toaster (1), sinkbasin (1), fridge (1), sink (1), microwave (1), drawer (1-3), stoveburner (1-4), coffeemachine (1), diningtable (1)

**Answer Choices**
(1): go to countertop 1
(2): go to cabinet 1
(3): go to cabinet 2
(4): go to cabinet 3
(5): go to garbagecan 1
(6): go to cabinet 4
(7): go to toaster 1
(8): go to sinkbasin 1
(9): go to sink 1
(10): go to cabinet 5
(11): go to microwave 1
(12): go to countertop 2
(13): go to cabinet 6
(14): go to cabinet 7
(15): go to drawer 1
(16): go to stoveburner 1
(17): go to stoveburner 2
(18): go to cabinet 8
(19): go to drawer 2
(20): go to stoveburner 3
(21): go to stoveburner 4
(22): go to coffeemachine 1
(23): go to cabinet 9
(24): go to cabinet 10
(25): go to cabinet 11
(26): go to diningtable 1
(27): go to drawer 3
(28): open fridge 1
(29): close fridge 1
(30): take bread 2 from fridge 1
(31): take cup 1 from fridge 1
(32): take cup 2 from fridge 1


**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.

Original Response:
Firstly, we need to identify all visible household objects in the images. In all three images, we see the inside of a fridge with two objects: bread and a cup. There is no tomato visible in any of the images.

Next, according to the task description "put a clean tomato in garbagecan," we need to find a tomato, clean it, and then put it in the garbagecan. Since there is no tomato in the fridge, we need to search for it elsewhere.

Based on the initial observation, we should first look for the tomato on countertops or cabinets where food items are usually stored. The sink or sinkbasin will be used to clean the tomato, and then we'll go to the garbagecan to dispose of it.

The most reasonable action to start with would be to search the countertops and cabinets for the tomato. Therefore, the answer should be one of the options that involve going to either a countertop or a cabinet.

Since there is no specific information about where the tomato might be, we should start with the closest options to minimize the search time.

The answer is: (1): go to countertop 1.
