VLM Prompt:
Image1:

Image2:
<image>
Image3:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a clean tomato in garbagecan."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a sink or a basin, clean the object with a sink or basin, and then find the correct location to place it and put it down there. The agent does not need to use soap bottle or faucet to clean the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "clean the object with the sink or sink basin"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a clean tomato in garbagecan"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see countertop (1-2), cabinet (1-11), garbagecan (1), toaster (1), sinkbasin (1), fridge (1), sink (1), microwave (1), drawer (1-3), stoveburner (1-4), coffeemachine (1), diningtable (1)

Original Response:
First, we need to identify if there is a tomato in any of the images provided. Image 1 shows the inside of a fridge with a loaf of bread and a wooden object which is not a tomato. Image 2 and Image 3 are identical and show a countertop with a toaster, a sink, and a pan on it, but no tomato.

Since the task description is "put a clean tomato in garbagecan," we need to find a tomato first. As per the initial observation, there are several places where a tomato could be, such as the countertop, cabinet, or fridge. However, we have already checked the fridge and one of the countertops, and there is no tomato there.

The most reasonable action would be to continue searching for the tomato in the remaining places.

The answer is: (2): go to cabinet 2
