VLM Prompt:
Image1:

Image2:
<image>
Image3:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a cool pan in stoveburner."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a cool pan in stoveburner"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see cabinet (1-14), countertop (1-2), microwave (1), drawer (1-5), sink (1), sinkbasin (1), coffeemachine (1), stoveburner (1-4), toaster (1), fridge (1), diningtable (1), garbagecan (1), safe (1)

**Answer Choices**
(1): go to cabinet 2

**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.

Original Response:
First, we need to find a pan which is the object relevant to the task description "put a cool pan in stoveburner." Analyzing Image1 and Image2, there is no pan visible in the scene. Image3 is identical to Image2, so no new information is provided there.

According to the **Initial Observation**, there are several places where a pan could potentially be found, such as the cabinets or drawers. The task hint indicates that the agent needs to cool the object with the fridge but does not need to interact with the fridge's button or door. So, before we can put a cool pan in a stoveburner, we need to find a pan.

Since the images do not show a pan, we must search the locations listed in the **Initial Observation**. We can eliminate some locations that would not typically store a pan, such as the microwave, sink, sinkbasin, coffeemachine, toaster, fridge (since we don't need to interact with it other than cooling the pan), diningtable, garbagecan, and safe.

This leaves us with the cabinets, drawers, and countertops. Among these, cabinets and drawers are the most common storage places for pans. 

The answer is: (1): go to cabinet 2
