VLM Prompt:
Image1:

Image2:
<image>
Image3:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a cool pan in stoveburner."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a cool pan in stoveburner"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see cabinet (1-14), countertop (1-2), microwave (1), drawer (1-5), sink (1), sinkbasin (1), coffeemachine (1), stoveburner (1-4), toaster (1), fridge (1), diningtable (1), garbagecan (1), safe (1)

**Answer Choices**
(1): go to cabinet 1
(2): go to cabinet 2
(3): go to countertop 1
(4): go to cabinet 5
(5): go to microwave 1
(6): go to cabinet 6
(7): go to drawer 1
(8): go to drawer 2
(9): go to drawer 3
(10): go to cabinet 7
(11): go to cabinet 8
(12): go to sink 1
(13): go to sinkbasin 1
(14): go to coffeemachine 1
(15): go to cabinet 9
(16): go to cabinet 10
(17): go to drawer 4
(18): go to cabinet 11
(19): go to stoveburner 1
(20): go to stoveburner 2
(21): go to stoveburner 3
(22): go to stoveburner 4
(23): go to cabinet 12
(24): go to toaster 1
(25): go to drawer 5
(26): go to countertop 2
(27): go to fridge 1
(28): go to cabinet 13
(29): go to cabinet 14
(30): go to diningtable 1
(31): go to garbagecan 1
(32): go to safe 1
(33): open cabinet 4
(34): close cabinet 4
(35): examine cabinet 4


**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.

Original Response:
First, we must identify if there is a pan visible in the images provided. Image 1 only shows a wooden surface, which appears to be a cabinet or drawer. Image 2 and Image 3 are identical and show a countertop with a microwave, a paper towel holder with paper towels, and a cabinet below. There is no pan visible on the countertop or inside the opened cabinet (cabinet 4).

Since there is no pan in the visible area, we must search every place based on the Initial Observation to find a pan. The most reasonable places to find a pan would be inside a cabinet or a drawer near the stove, as pans are commonly stored in those areas in a household.

Based on the options provided and the Initial Observation, the most reasonable action to find a pan would be to check the cabinets and drawers near the stoveburner. Since cabinet 4 is already open and no pan is visible, we can eliminate that option.

Therefore, the answer is:
(1): go to cabinet 1
