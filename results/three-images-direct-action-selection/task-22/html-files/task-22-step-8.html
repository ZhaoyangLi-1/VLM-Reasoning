**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a hot egg in countertop."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a microwave, heat the object with the microwave, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the microwave button or open the microwave to heat the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "heat the object with the microwave"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a hot egg in countertop"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

Original Response:
Image 1 shows a closed cabinet with no objects visible.
Image 2 shows a closed fridge with no objects visible.
Image 3 shows the inside of the fridge with visible objects: bread, lettuce, bowl, potato, and apple.

According to the initial observation, there are several cabinets, countertops, and other household objects. However, none of the images show an egg or a countertop with an egg on it. Since the task is to "put a hot egg in countertop," we need to find an egg first.

The task hint indicates that the agent must find the object (in this case, an egg), pick it up, heat it in the microwave, and then place it on the correct location (countertop). Since we cannot see an egg in the provided images, we must search other places.

There are no eggs visible in the fridge, which means the egg is likely stored in one of the cabinets or drawers. The most reasonable action is to start searching the cabinets, as eggs are commonly stored there rather than on countertops or in drawers.

The answer is: (1): go to cabinet 1
