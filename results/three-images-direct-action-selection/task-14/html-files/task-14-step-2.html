Image3:

**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a cool apple in countertop."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a cool apple in countertop"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

Original Response:
First, analyze the provided images:

Image1 shows a sink with two basins, a pair of taps, and a glass sitting in one of the basins. There is also a window with yellow checkered curtains above the sink. There are no visible apples or any other objects that could be relevant to the task.

Image2 and Image3 are identical and show a fridge with a black textured surface. The fridge appears to be closed, and there are no objects visible on the fridge or in its immediate vicinity. There is no indication of the fridge's contents from the images provided.

Considering the "Initial Observation," which includes the locations of various household objects, we can determine that the task requires finding an apple, cooling it with the fridge, and placing it on the countertop. Since the images do not show any apples and the instruction states that the agent does not need to open the fridge or use the fridge button to cool the object, we can assume that the agent needs to find the apple first.

Since the apple is not visible in the provided images, we must search every place based on the "Initial Observation" to find the object. The most logical locations to find an apple would be the countertop, cabinet, or drawer, as these are common places where fruit might be stored in a kitchen.

The answer is: (2): go to countertop 1.
