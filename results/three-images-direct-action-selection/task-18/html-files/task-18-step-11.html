VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
Image2:
<image>
Image3:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a cool pot in cabinet."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a cool pot in cabinet"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.

Original Response:
1. The visible household objects in the images are cabinets with brass-colored handles. The images show cabinet doors, and we can see that in Image 1, cabinet 3 is closed, while in Image 2 and Image 3, cabinet 3 is open. There are no pots or any other objects visible inside the cabinet or taken in hand.

2. According to the task description "put a cool pot in cabinet" and the task hint, the agent must find a pot, cool it with the fridge, and then place it in the correct cabinet. Since there is no pot visible in the images and the fridge is not shown, the agent must search for these objects based on the Initial Observation.

3. Since the images do not show the pot or the fridge, the agent would first need to go to the fridge to cool the pot. Therefore, the most reasonable action from the choices would be to go to the fridge first.

The answer is: (10): go to fridge 1
