VLM Prompt:

Image2:

Image3:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a cool pot in cabinet."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a cool pot in cabinet"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see cabinet (1-20), countertop (1-3), coffeemachine (1), toaster (1), sink (1), fridge (1), microwave (1), garbagecan (1), drawer (1-3), sinkbasin (1), stoveburner (1-4), shelf (1-3)

**Answer Choices**
(1): go to cabinet 2
(2): go to cabinet 3
(3): go to cabinet 4
(4): go to cabinet 6
(5): go to countertop 1
(6): go to coffeemachine 1
(7): go to cabinet 7
(8): go to toaster 1
(9): go to cabinet 8
(10): go to sink 1
(11): go to fridge 1
(12): go to microwave 1
(13): go to garbagecan 1
(14): go to cabinet 9
(15): go to cabinet 10
(16): go to countertop 2
(17): go to cabinet 11
(18): go to cabinet 12
(19): go to drawer 1
(20): go to countertop 3
(21): go to drawer 2
(22): go to cabinet 13
(23): go to sinkbasin 1
(24): go to cabinet 14
(25): go to drawer 3
(26): go to stoveburner 1
(27): go to stoveburner 2
(28): go to stoveburner 3
(29): go to cabinet 15
(30): go to stoveburner 4
(31): go to cabinet 16
(32): go to cabinet 17
(33): go to cabinet 18
(34): go to cabinet 19
(35): go to cabinet 20
(36): go to shelf 1
(37): go to shelf 2
(38): go to shelf 3
(39): open cabinet 1
(40): close cabinet 1
(41): examine cabinet 1


**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.

Original Response:
Firstly, we need to identify the visible household objects in the provided images. In all three images, we can see a set of cabinets on the wall. In Image1, all cabinets are closed. In Image2, cabinet 1 is open, and in Image3, cabinet 1 is closed again.

Comparing the difference between the images, we notice that the only change is the opening and closing of cabinet 1. Since the task description is "put a cool pot in cabinet," we can infer that the pot is not visibly present in these images, and therefore, we must search for it.

Based on the initial observation, we know that there are several cabinets numbered 1-20. The images show us cabinet 1, which has been opened and closed but does not contain the pot we need to cool. Since we do not need to interact with the fridge to cool the object, we can skip the step of "go to fridge 1" (answer choice 11).

Given that we need to find a pot, cool it, and then put it in a cabinet, the most reasonable action from the choices would be to first locate the pot. However, since we do not have an option that directly states "find a pot," we should choose an action that involves searching for the pot.

Since the provided images and initial observation do not give any indication of where the pot might be, we should choose a general action that allows us to search for it. None of the answer choices directly suggest searching for a pot, but we can start by going to a location where a pot might be found, such as a cabinet or a countertop.

The answer is: (1): go to cabinet 2. This action allows us to start searching for the pot in the cabinets, following the sequence given in the initial observation.
