**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a cool pot in cabinet."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a cool pot in cabinet"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.
----------------------------------------

----------------------------------------

Original Response:
1. Analyzing the images:
   - Image 1 & 2: Both images show closed cabinets with no visible pots or objects to be cooled.
   - Image 3: Shows a closed red drawer under a marble countertop with a window reflecting on it, no pots visible.

2. The task is to put a cool pot in the cabinet. According to the task hint, the agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object. Therefore, the agent must first find a pot.

3. Based on the initial observation, we should look for a pot in the locations mentioned. Since none of the provided images show a pot or an open cabinet where a pot might be found, the most reasonable action would be to search the cabinets starting from cabinet 1 onward as it's not specified which cabinet the pot might be in.

The answer is: (1): go to cabinet 2
