Image3:

**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a cool pot in cabinet."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a cool pot in cabinet"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

Original Response:
The task description is "put a cool pot in cabinet." To accomplish this, the agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge but must "cool the object with the fridge." 

Analyzing the provided images, we do not see a pot in any of the images. Therefore, we must search every place based on the Initial Observation to find the pot. Once the pot is found, the agent must go to the fridge (12) to cool the pot and then find the correct cabinet to place it in.

Since no specific cabinet number is mentioned in the task description, we cannot determine which cabinet to put the cool pot in just by looking at the images. We must look for a pot first.

The answer is: (12): go to fridge 1.
