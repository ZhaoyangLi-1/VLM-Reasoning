VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a cool pot in cabinet."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a cool pot in cabinet"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.
----------------------------------------

----------------------------------------

Original Response:
Image Analysis:
- There is a coffee machine with a mug on its tray.
- The sink contains a few items: a drinking glass, an apple, a tomato, and a lettuce head.
- No pot is visible in the image.

Task Description Analysis:
- The task is to cool a pot with the fridge and then put it in a cabinet.

Given that no pot is visible in the image, we must search every place based on the Initial Observation to find the object.

Searching for the Pot:
- The pot is not on the countertop, coffee machine, toaster, sink, or any other visible surface in the image.
- We must check other places like cabinets, drawers, stove burners, and shelves to find the pot.

Cooling the Pot:
- Once the pot is found, the next step is to cool it with the fridge.

Placing the Pot in the Cabinet:
- After cooling the pot, we must find the correct cabinet to place it in.

Based on the task description and the images provided, the most reasonable first action would be to find the pot. Since the pot is not visible in the image, we must check storage areas such as cabinets and drawers. Therefore, the answer is to start by going to a cabinet or drawer to find the pot.

The answer is: (1): go to cabinet 1 (or any other cabinet or drawer number from the list where the pot could be).
