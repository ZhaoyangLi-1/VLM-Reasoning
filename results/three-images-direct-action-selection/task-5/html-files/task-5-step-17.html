**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a book in armchair."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, find the correct location to place it, and put it down there." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a book in armchair"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Answer**

Original Response:
First, we need to identify all visible household objects in the images provided. In all three images, we can see an armchair, a coffee table, a side table with a houseplant on it, and a part of a dresser. There is no visible book or drawer in any of the images.

Since the task is to "put a book in armchair," we need to find a book. According to the initial observation, there is a drawer that we haven't checked yet. The book could be in one of the drawers.

The most reasonable action from the choices provided would be to first find the book. Since we cannot see any book in the images, we need to search the places where a book might be kept, such as in a drawer. 

The answer is: (20): examine drawer 1.
