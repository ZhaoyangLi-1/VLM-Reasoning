VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
Image2:
<image>
Image3:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put some cd on safe."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, find the correct location to place it, and put it down there." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put some cd on safe"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see bed (1-2), dresser (1), sidetable (1-2), drawer (1-11), desk (1), garbagecan (1), safe (1)

**Answer Choices**
(1): go to bed 1
(2): go to dresser 1
(3): go to bed 2
(4): go to sidetable 1
(5): go to drawer 1
(6): go to drawer 2
(7): go to sidetable 2
(8): go to drawer 3
(9): go to drawer 4
(10): go to desk 1
(11): go to garbagecan 1
(12): go to drawer 5
(13): go to drawer 6
(14): go to drawer 7
(15): go to drawer 8
(16): go to drawer 9
(17): go to drawer 10
(18): go to drawer 11
(19): close safe 1
(20): put cd 1 in/on safe 1
(21): examine cd 1


**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.

Original Response:
Image Analysis:
- In all three images, we see a safe, a bowl, a cup with a spoon, and a CD on the surface of what appears to be a dresser or side table.
- In Image 1, the safe is closed.
- In Image 2, the safe is open.
- In Image 3, the safe remains open and the CD has been moved closer to the edge of the dresser or side table, suggesting it may have been picked up or is ready to be picked up.

Task Analysis:
- The task is to put some CDs on the safe.
- The CD is visible in all images, so we do not need to search every place based on the initial observation.
- The safe is the correct location to place the CD, and it is open in Images 2 and 3, ready to receive an item.

Decision:
- Based on the task description "put some cd on safe" and the analysis of the images, the most reasonable action is to put the CD into the open safe.

The answer is: (20): put cd 1 in/on safe 1
