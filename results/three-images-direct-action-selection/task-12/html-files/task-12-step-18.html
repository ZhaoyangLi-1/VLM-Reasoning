VLM Prompt:
Image1:

Image2:
<image>
Image3:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "clean some tomato and put it in countertop."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a sink or a basin, clean the object with a sink or basin, and then find the correct location to place it and put it down there. The agent does not need to use soap bottle or faucet to clean the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "clean the object with the sink or sink basin"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "clean some tomato and put it in countertop"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see cabinet (1-6), microwave (1), countertop (1-2), coffeemachine (1), toaster (1), sink (1), sinkbasin (1), fridge (1)

**Answer Choices**
(1): go to cabinet 1
(2): go to cabinet 2
(3): go to microwave 1
(4): go to cabinet 4
(5): go to cabinet 5
(6): go to cabinet 6
(7): go to countertop 1
(8): go to coffeemachine 1
(9): go to toaster 1
(10): go to countertop 2
(11): go to sink 1
(12): go to sinkbasin 1
(13): close fridge 1
(14): take apple 1 from fridge 1
(15): take potato 1 from fridge 1
(16): examine fridge 1


**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.

Original Response:
Firstly, we need to analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects. In Image1, we can see a cabinet with closed doors, and there is no object in hand or on the countertops that is relevant to the task. In Image2 and Image3, which are identical, we can see a fridge with the door open, revealing two objects on the shelves: an apple and a potato.

Comparing the images, there is no visible difference between them in terms of objects being opened or taken in hand.

Considering the task description "clean some tomato and put it in countertop" and the task hint, the agent must find a tomato, clean it in a sink or basin, and place it on the countertop. Based on the **Initial Observation**, we know the locations of cabinets, countertop, and sink. However, none of the images show a tomato or indicate where one might be found.

Given the **Answer Choices**, the most reasonable action would be to search the cabinets since tomatoes are typically not stored in a fridge, microwave, coffeemachine, or toaster, and they are not visible on the countertop or in the sink basin. Additionally, since we know the fridge contains an apple and a potato, there is no need to examine or take objects from the fridge.

Therefore, the answer is: (1): go to cabinet 1. If the tomato is not found there, the agent should continue searching the cabinets (2, 4, 5, 6) until the tomato is found. Once the tomato is found, the agent should then go to the sink or sinkbasin to clean it and subsequently go to the countertop to place it down.
