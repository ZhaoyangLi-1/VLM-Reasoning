VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
Image2:
<image>
Image3:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "clean some tomato and put it in countertop."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a sink or a basin, clean the object with a sink or basin, and then find the correct location to place it and put it down there. The agent does not need to use soap bottle or faucet to clean the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "clean the object with the sink or sink basin"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "clean some tomato and put it in countertop"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see cabinet (1-6), microwave (1), countertop (1-2), coffeemachine (1), toaster (1), sink (1), sinkbasin (1), fridge (1)

**Answer Choices**
(1): go to cabinet 1
(2): go to cabinet 3
(3): go to microwave 1
(4): go to cabinet 4
(5): go to cabinet 5
(6): go to cabinet 6
(7): go to countertop 1
(8): go to coffeemachine 1
(9): go to toaster 1
(10): go to countertop 2
(11): go to sink 1
(12): go to sinkbasin 1
(13): open cabinet 2
(14): close cabinet 2
(15): examine cabinet 2


**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.

Original Response:
Firstly, we analyze the images provided. Image1 and Image3 are identical, showing a closed cabinet with a handle. Image2 shows a dark and unlit area with shelves, an apple, and an orange, but no tomato or sink is visible. 

Based on the task description "clean some tomato and put it in countertop," we need to find a tomato, clean it, and place it on the countertop. 

The analysis of images shows that there is no visible tomato or sink/basin in the provided images. Therefore, we need to search every place based on the initial observation to find the tomato and the sink or basin.

The most reasonable action from the choices provided for the task would be to first find a tomato. As there is no tomato in the images, we should search the places where a tomato is most likely to be found, which would be in the cabinets or the fridge. 

Since we are looking for a tomato to clean, the action related to the sink or basin is not relevant until we have the tomato. Therefore, the most reasonable action would be to open a cabinet where we might find a tomato.

The answer is: (13): open cabinet 2.
