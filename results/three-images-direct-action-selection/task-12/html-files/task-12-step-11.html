VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
Image2:
<image>
Image3:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "clean some tomato and put it in countertop."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a sink or a basin, clean the object with a sink or basin, and then find the correct location to place it and put it down there. The agent does not need to use soap bottle or faucet to clean the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "clean the object with the sink or sink basin"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "clean some tomato and put it in countertop"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see cabinet (1-6), microwave (1), countertop (1-2), coffeemachine (1), toaster (1), sink (1), sinkbasin (1), fridge (1)

**Answer Choices**
(1): go to cabinet 1
(2): go to cabinet 2
(3): go to cabinet 3
(4): go to microwave 1
(5): go to cabinet 4
(6): go to cabinet 5
(7): go to cabinet 6
(8): go to countertop 1
(9): go to coffeemachine 1
(10): go to toaster 1
(11): go to countertop 2
(12): go to sink 1
(13): take faucet 1 from sinkbasin 1
(14): take plate 1 from sinkbasin 1
(15): examine sinkbasin 1


**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.

Original Response:
Firstly, we need to identify all visible household objects from the provided images. In Image1 and Image2, we can see a shelf with a tomato and a potato on it. Since these images are identical and do not show any interaction with the objects, they don't provide information about the task at hand. Image3 shows a sink with a visible faucet and a clean sink basin, but no tomato is present.

Based on the task description "clean some tomato and put it in countertop," we know that the agent must first find a tomato, then clean it in a sink or basin, and finally place it on a countertop.

From the answer choices, we can eliminate options (4), (9), (10), and (13) since they are not relevant to the task (microwave, coffee machine, toaster, and faucet are not needed for this task). We can also eliminate options (14) and (15) since they involve examining or taking objects from the sink basin, but we need to find a tomato first.

Since we have identified a tomato on a shelf in the images, which most closely resembles a cabinet, and none of the images show a tomato in a sink or on a countertop, the most reasonable next action would be to go to the cabinet where the tomato is located.

Since the initial observation mentions cabinets numbered 1-6 and the images do not specify which number the cabinet with the tomato corresponds to, we must choose the option that involves checking the cabinets. Therefore, the most reasonable action would be to search every cabinet based on the initial observation to find the tomato.

The answer is: (1): go to cabinet 1, (2): go to cabinet 2, (3): go to cabinet 3, (5): go to cabinet 4, (6): go to cabinet 5, (7): go to cabinet 6.
