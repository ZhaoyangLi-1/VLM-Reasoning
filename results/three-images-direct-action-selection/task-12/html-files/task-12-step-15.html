VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
Image2:
<image>
Image3:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "clean some tomato and put it in countertop."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a sink or a basin, clean the object with a sink or basin, and then find the correct location to place it and put it down there. The agent does not need to use soap bottle or faucet to clean the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "clean the object with the sink or sink basin"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "clean some tomato and put it in countertop"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see cabinet (1-6), microwave (1), countertop (1-2), coffeemachine (1), toaster (1), sink (1), sinkbasin (1), fridge (1)

**Answer Choices**
(1): go to cabinet 3
(2): go to microwave 1
(3): go to cabinet 4
(4): go to cabinet 5
(5): go to cabinet 6
(6): go to countertop 1
(7): go to coffeemachine 1
(8): go to toaster 1
(9): go to countertop 2
(10): go to sink 1
(11): go to sinkbasin 1
(12): open cabinet 2
(13): close cabinet 2
(14): take bowl 1 from cabinet 2
(15): examine cabinet 2


**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.

Original Response:
First, we analyze the images for any visible household objects relevant to the task "clean some tomato and put it in countertop."

In Image1, we can see a shelf with one tomato and another round object which is not clear. There does not appear to be any sink or sink basin visible in this image, so it's unlikely we can complete the cleaning task here.

Image2 and Image3 are identical and show a cabinet with no visible contents as it is closed. There is a bright reflection which makes it hard to determine the content of the cabinet or if it's relevant to the task.

Based on the initial observation, we know there is a sink and sink basin available in the room. Since the task is to clean a tomato, we look for the place where the tomato is stored and a place to clean it.

Since we cannot see inside the cabinets from the images, we need to search every place to find the object. According to the task description, the agent must find a tomato, clean it, and then put it on the countertop. The most reasonable action to start this task would be to find the tomato. Since the tomato is not visible in the provided images, we will search the cabinets where food items like tomatoes are typically stored.

The answer is: (1): go to cabinet 3. This is based on the assumption that cabinet 3 might contain the tomato we need to find. If the tomato is not there, we would continue searching other cabinets. After finding and cleaning the tomato, the next reasonable action would be to place it on the countertop.
