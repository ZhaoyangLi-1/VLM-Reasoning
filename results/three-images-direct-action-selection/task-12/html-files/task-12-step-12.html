VLM Prompt:
Image1:

Image2:
<image>
Image3:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "clean some tomato and put it in countertop."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a sink or a basin, clean the object with a sink or basin, and then find the correct location to place it and put it down there. The agent does not need to use soap bottle or faucet to clean the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "clean the object with the sink or sink basin"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "clean some tomato and put it in countertop"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see cabinet (1-6), microwave (1), countertop (1-2), coffeemachine (1), toaster (1), sink (1), sinkbasin (1), fridge (1)

**Answer Choices**
(1): go to cabinet 1
(2): go to cabinet 2
(3): go to cabinet 3
(4): go to microwave 1
(5): go to cabinet 4
(6): go to cabinet 5
(7): go to cabinet 6
(8): go to countertop 1
(9): go to coffeemachine 1
(10): go to toaster 1
(11): go to countertop 2
(12): go to sink 1
(13): go to fridge 1
(14): take faucet 1 from sinkbasin 1
(15): take plate 1 from sinkbasin 1
(16): examine sinkbasin 1


**Answer**

Original Response:
Image1: 
- There are no tomatoes visible in the image. There are two objects that resemble fruits on the shelf, but they are not tomatoes.
- There is a cabinet that appears to be closed.

Image2 and Image3: 
- These two images are identical, showing a sink with a faucet and a sink basin. There is no tomato or any other object in either the sink or on the countertop.

Based on the Initial Observation:
- The task is to clean a tomato and put it on the countertop.
- There is no tomato visible in the provided images.

Considering the task and the initial observation, the agent needs to find a tomato. A tomato is most likely to be found in a cabinet or the fridge. As the task does not specify which cabinet or whether the tomato is in the fridge, the agent should start by checking the cabinets and the fridge.

The answer is: (13): go to fridge 1
