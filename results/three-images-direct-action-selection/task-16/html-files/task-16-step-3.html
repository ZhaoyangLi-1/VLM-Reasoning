VLM Prompt:

Image2:

Image3:

**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a cool pan in sinkbasin."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a cool pan in sinkbasin"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

Original Response:
Image Analysis:
- Image 1 and Image 2: These images are almost identical and show a stove with two kettles on the stove burners, a frying pan on the countertop, and a salt shaker next to the pan. No pan appears to be cool or in someone's hand.
- Image 3: This image shows a spoon and a pot on the countertop. The pot does not appear to be in the sink basin or cool.

Task Description Analysis:
The task is to put a cool pan in the sink basin. The agent must find a pan, cool it with the fridge, and then place it in the sink basin. In the images provided, we do not see a fridge, but we do see a pan on the countertop.

Initial Observation:
The initial observation mentions a fridge and a sink basin, which are relevant to the task.

Based on the analysis, the most reasonable action to accomplish the task of putting a cool pan in the sink basin would be to first go to the fridge to cool the pan.

The answer is: (19): go to fridge 1
