**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a cool tomato in microwave."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a cool tomato in microwave"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see cabinet (1-15), fridge (1), countertop (1-4), drawer (1-4), microwave (1), toaster (1), coffeemachine (1), garbagecan (1), sink (1), stoveburner (1-3), sinkbasin (1)

**Answer Choices**
(1): go to cabinet 1
(2): go to cabinet 2
(3): go to cabinet 3
(4): go to countertop 1
(5): go to cabinet 4
(6): go to cabinet 5
(7): go to cabinet 6
(8): go to cabinet 7
(9): go to drawer 1
(10): go to drawer 2
(11): go to cabinet 8
(12): go to drawer 3
(13): go to cabinet 9
(14): go to cabinet 10
(15): go to drawer 4
(16): go to microwave 1
(17): go to cabinet 11
(18): go to toaster 1
(19): go to cabinet 12
(20): go to cabinet 13
(21): go to cabinet 14
(22): go to cabinet 15
(23): go to countertop 2
(24): go to coffeemachine 1
(25): go to garbagecan 1
(26): go to countertop 3
(27): go to countertop 4
(28): go to sink 1
(29): go to stoveburner 1
(30): go to stoveburner 2
(31): go to stoveburner 3
(32): go to sinkbasin 1
(33): close fridge 1
(34): put apple 1 in/on fridge 1
(35): examine apple 1
(36): examine fridge 1


**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.
----------------------------------------

----------------------------------------

Original Response:
The images provided show a kitchen scene with various household objects. An apple, a pan, a mug, and a bowl can be seen on the shelves in the first two images. The third image shows the same apple from a different angle, with the ceiling and two pictures with magnets on what appears to be a refrigerator. 

Based on the task, "put a cool tomato in microwave," we need to find a tomato first. In the images provided, we see an apple, but no tomato is visible. Therefore, we must search other locations based on the initial observation to find a tomato.

Since we need to cool the tomato first before putting it in the microwave, the fridge would be the logical place to look for a cool tomato, but the task hint states that the agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object. Therefore, we do not need to interact with the fridge to cool the tomato; we just need to find a tomato.

Given that we have not seen a tomato in the provided images, we must search the cabinets, as they are common places where one might store a tomato in a kitchen setting. 

The answer is: (1): go to cabinet 1. This is the first cabinet to check for a tomato, and as none of the answer choices specify searching for a tomato, this is the closest action we can take to progress with the task. If a tomato is not found in cabinet 1, the next reasonable action would be to continue searching the other cabinets in numerical order.
