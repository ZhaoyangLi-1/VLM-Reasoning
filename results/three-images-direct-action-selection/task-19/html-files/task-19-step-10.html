VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
Image2:
<image>
Image3:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a cool tomato in microwave."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a cool tomato in microwave"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

----------------------------------------

Original Response:
1. Image 1 and 2 are identical, showing a microwave with a mug and a potato on a plate inside, and the microwave is turned off. Image 3 shows a closed cabinet. None of the images show a tomato or a fridge.

2. Based on the task description "put a cool tomato in microwave," the agent needs to find a tomato, cool it in the fridge, and then put it in the microwave. Since the images do not show a tomato or a fridge, the agent needs to search for these objects.

3. Since the agent must cool the tomato with the fridge, the most reasonable action from the choices provided would be to go to the fridge.

The answer is: (3): go to fridge 1.
