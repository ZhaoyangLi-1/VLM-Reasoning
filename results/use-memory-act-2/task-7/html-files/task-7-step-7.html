VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to put some creditcard on coffeetable. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a credit card.
2. Pick up the credit card.
3. Find a coffee table.
4. Place the picked-up credit card on the coffee table.
5. Find another credit card.
6. Pick up the second credit card.
7. Return to the coffee table.
8. Place the second picked-up credit card on the coffee table with the first one.

**Current Observation**

1. Step Index in the Plan: 3
2. Objects: Credit Cards, Sofa
3. Action: go to coffeetable 1
State 4:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 4

State 7:
1. Step Index in the Plan: Not clearly defined, presumed to be finding the second credit card
2. Objects: Coffee Table (partial view)
3. Action: go to drawer 3


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to armchair 1
(2): go to armchair 2
(3): go to garbagecan 1
(4): go to cabinet 1
(5): go to drawer 1
(6): go to cabinet 2
(7): go to cabinet 3
(8): go to drawer 4
(9): go to cabinet 4
(10): go to coffeetable 1
(11): go to sidetable 1
(12): go to sofa 1
(13): open drawer 3
(14): close drawer 3
(15): put box 1 in/on drawer 3
(16): examine box 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: Based on the historical data, the agent has already picked up a credit card and placed it on the coffee table, then moved to find another credit card. The current observation does not show any credit cards, and the current step in the plan should be step number 5: "Find another credit card." The visible objects in the current observation are a laptop and parts of a table, but no credit cards are visible. Therefore, we cannot complete the current step with the current observation. The most appropriate action would be to search for the second credit card by going to a location where it might be found, taking into account that the agent has already visited several drawers and a dresser. The "go to" actions related to furniture pieces where a credit card might be hidden or placed are the best options.

The Most Appropriate Action: (7): go to cabinet 3

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

**Context**
Analysis: Based on the historical data, the agent has already picked up a credit card and placed it on the coffee table, then moved to find another credit card. The current observation does not show any credit cards, and the current step in the plan should be step number 5: "Find another credit card." The visible objects in the current observation are a laptop and parts of a table, but no credit cards are visible. Therefore, we cannot complete the current step with the current observation.
