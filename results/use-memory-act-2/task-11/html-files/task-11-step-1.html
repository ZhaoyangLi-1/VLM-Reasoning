VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to put a clean soapbar in bathtubbasin. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a soapbar.
2. Pick up the soapbar.
3. Find a sink or basin.
4. Clean the soapbar with the sink or basin.
5. Find a bathtub basin.
6. Place the cleaned soapbar in the bathtub basin.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
State 1:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Countertop, Sink, Partial View of Toilet
3. Action: go to cabinet 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to bathtub 1
(2): go to bathtubbasin 1
(3): go to toilet 1
(4): go to countertop 1
(5): go to sink 1
(6): go to sinkbasin 1
(7): go to cabinet 2
(8): go to garbagecan 1
(9): open cabinet 1
(10): close cabinet 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to find a soapbar. The current place appears to be a bathroom, based on the presence of a toilet, sink, and countertop. The visible objects related to the task in the current observation are the countertop, sink, and a partial view of the toilet. There is no soapbar visible in the current observation. Based on the history, we have previously taken action to go to cabinet 1 but there is no information on whether that action resulted in finding a soapbar. Since the plan requires us to find a soapbar and it is not visible in the current observation, we cannot complete this step with the current observation. The most appropriate action would be to try opening cabinet 1 to search for a soapbar inside. 

The Most Appropriate Action: (9): open cabinet 1

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

**Context**
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to find a soapbar. The current place appears to be a bathroom, based on the presence of a toilet, sink, and countertop. The visible objects related to the task in the current observation are the countertop, sink, and a partial view of the toilet. There is no soapbar visible in the current observation. Based on the history, we have previously taken action to go to cabinet 1 but there is no information on whether that action resulted in finding a soapbar. Since the plan requires us to find a soapbar and it is not visible in the current observation, we cannot complete this step with the current observation. The most appropriate action would be to try opening cabinet 1 to search for a soapbar inside. 

The Most Appropriate Action: (9): open cabinet 1

Please summarize the context by following above examples when providing the summary, and ensure that only the summary is included, without any extra explanation.
