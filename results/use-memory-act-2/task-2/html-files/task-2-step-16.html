VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to look at pen under the desklamp. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a pen.
2. Pick up the pen.
3. Locate a desklamp.
4. Turn on the desklamp.
5. Position the pen under the light of the desklamp.
6. Look at the pen under the desklamp.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.

4. Action: go to desk 1
State 16:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 4
2. Objects: Speaker or Cylindrical Object (irrelevant)
3. Action: go to sidetable 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to bed 1
(2): go to dresser 1
(3): go to bed 2
(4): go to drawer 1
(5): go to sidetable 1
(6): go to drawer 2
(7): go to sidetable 2
(8): go to drawer 3
(9): go to drawer 4
(10): go to garbagecan 1
(11): go to drawer 5
(12): go to drawer 6
(13): go to drawer 7
(14): go to drawer 8
(15): go to drawer 9
(16): go to drawer 10
(17): go to drawer 11
(18): go to safe 1
(19): put alarmclock 1 in/on desk 1
(20): examine alarmclock 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: According to the plan, our current objective is to look at the pen under the desklamp, which is step 6 in the plan. From the history, we have picked up the pen (step 2) and located the desklamp (step 3). Step 4 in the plan is to turn on the desklamp, and step 5 is to position the pen under the light of the desklamp. However, the current observation does not show the desklamp, which means we cannot complete steps 4 or 5 with the current observation. The history indicates that we were at the desk in the previous actions, and since the desklamp is usually located on or near a desk, we should move to a position where the desklamp is visible. The most appropriate action to take would be to go to sidetable 1, as this is often where a desklamp is placed, and it is one of the admissible actions.

The Most Appropriate Action: (5): go to sidetable 1.

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

**Context**
Analysis: According to the plan, our current objective is to look at the pen under the desklamp, which is step 6 in the plan. From the history, we have picked up the pen (step 2) and located the desklamp (step 3). Step 4 in the plan is to turn on the desklamp, and step 5 is to position the pen under the light of the desklamp. However, the current observation does not show the desklamp, which means we cannot complete steps 4 or 5 with the current observation. The history indicates that we were at the desk in the previous actions, and since the desklamp is usually located on or near a desk, we should move to a position where the desklamp is visible. The most appropriate action to take would be to go to sidetable 1, as this is often where a desklamp is placed, and it is one of the admissible actions.

The Most Appropriate Action: (5): go to sidetable 1.

Please summarize the context by following above examples when providing the summary, and ensure that only the summary is included, without any extra explanation.
