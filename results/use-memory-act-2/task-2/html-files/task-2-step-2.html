VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to look at pen under the desklamp. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a pen.
2. Pick up the pen.
3. Locate a desklamp.
4. Turn on the desklamp.
5. Position the pen under the light of the desklamp.
6. Look at the pen under the desklamp.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
State 1:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: (none specified)
3. Action: go to desk 1
State 2:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Pencil, Desk
3. Action: go to drawer 3


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to bed 1
(2): go to dresser 1
(3): go to bed 2
(4): go to drawer 1
(5): go to sidetable 1
(6): go to drawer 2
(7): go to sidetable 2
(8): go to drawer 4
(9): go to garbagecan 1
(10): go to drawer 5
(11): go to drawer 6
(12): go to drawer 7
(13): go to drawer 8
(14): go to drawer 9
(15): go to drawer 10
(16): go to drawer 11
(17): go to safe 1
(18): open drawer 3
(19): close drawer 3

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: According to the plan, the current step is to find a pen, which we have not yet completed. The current observation shows us in front of a desk with a pen visible on it. This means we are ready to complete step 1 of the plan. Based on the history information, we have previously gone to the desk and the drawer, which brought us to the current location with the pen in sight. The visible objects related to the task in the current observation are a pen and a desklamp. Since the pen is the object we need for the current step and it is within reach, we can proceed to the next step in the plan, which is to pick up the pen.

The Most Appropriate Action: (18): open drawer 3

Note: The chosen action may seem counterintuitive since the pen is already visible on the desk, but none of the admissible actions listed include picking up the pen directly. Opening drawer 3 may reveal additional objects or tools that could help with the task, such as a pen holder or a flashlight to better illuminate the pen under the desklamp. If the intention was to pick up the pen directly, the admissible action should have been something like "pick up pen," which is not listed. Therefore, based on the available actions, opening drawer 3 is the most relevant next step.

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

**Context**
