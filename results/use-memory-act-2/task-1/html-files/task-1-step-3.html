VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to look at alarmclock under the desklamp. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find an alarm clock.
2. Pick up the alarm clock.
3. Find a desk lamp.
4. Turn on the desk lamp.
5. Position the alarm clock under the light of the desk lamp.
6. Look at the alarm clock under the desk lamp.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
State 1:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Dresser, Drawers, Shelf, Mug
3. Action: go to drawer 1
State 2:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 2
2. Objects: Alarm Clock, Desk Lamp, Laptop, Dresser
3. Action: go to dresser 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to bed 1
(2): go to drawer 2
(3): go to drawer 3
(4): go to drawer 4
(5): go to drawer 5
(6): go to garbagecan 1
(7): go to drawer 6
(8): go to drawer 7
(9): go to drawer 8
(10): go to drawer 9
(11): go to drawer 10
(12): go to shelf 1
(13): go to shelf 2
(14): go to shelf 3
(15): go to shelf 4
(16): go to shelf 5
(17): go to shelf 6
(18): go to shelf 7
(19): take laptop 1 from dresser 1
(20): take cd 1 from dresser 1
(21): take keychain 2 from dresser 1
(22): take creditcard 1 from dresser 1
(23): take pen 1 from dresser 1
(24): use desklamp 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: According to the history information, we have already found the alarm clock on the dresser (step 2 of the plan). The current observation shows a desk with a laptop, CD, keychain, credit card, and pen, but no desk lamp is visible. Therefore, we cannot complete the current step of finding a desk lamp with the current observation. As none of the admissible actions directly relate to finding or using a desk lamp, the best course of action is to explore the area for the desk lamp. Among the admissible actions, the only one that could potentially lead to finding the desk lamp is "use desklamp 1", which suggests that the desk lamp is present but not visible in the current observation due to the perspective. Since turning on the desk lamp is the next step in the plan after finding it, this action aligns with our objective.

The Most Appropriate Action: (24): use desklamp 1

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

**Context**
Analysis: According to the history information, we have already found the alarm clock on the dresser (step 2 of the plan). The current observation shows a desk with a laptop, CD, keychain, credit card, and pen, but no desk lamp is visible. Therefore, we cannot complete the current step of finding a desk lamp with the current observation. As none of the admissible actions directly relate to finding or using a desk lamp, the best course of action is to explore the area for the desk lamp. Among the admissible actions, the only one that could potentially lead to finding the desk lamp is "use desklamp 1", which suggests that the desk lamp is present but not visible in the current observation due to the perspective. Since turning on the desk lamp is the next step in the plan after finding it, this action aligns with our objective.

The Most Appropriate Action: (24): use desklamp 1

Please summarize the context by following above examples when providing the summary, and ensure that only the summary is included, without any extra explanation.
