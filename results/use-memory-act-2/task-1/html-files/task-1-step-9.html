VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to look at alarmclock under the desklamp. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find an alarm clock.
2. Pick up the alarm clock.
3. Find a desk lamp.
4. Turn on the desk lamp.
5. Position the alarm clock under the light of the desk lamp.
6. Look at the alarm clock under the desk lamp.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
State 1:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Dresser, Drawers, Shelf, Mug
3. Action: go to drawer 1
State 2:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 2
2. Objects: Alarm Clock, Desk Lamp, Laptop, Dresser
3. Action: go to dresser 1
State 4:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 3
2. Objects: Desk, Laptop, CD, Keychain, Credit Card, Pen, (Desk Lamp not visible)
3. Action: use desklamp 1
State 5:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 4
2. Objects: Desk, Various Items, Desk Lamp (not visible)
3. Action: go to shelf 1
State 6:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 2
2. Objects: Dresser, Alarm Clock
3. Action: take alarmclock 2 from shelf 1
State 7:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 5
2. Objects: Alarm Clock, Dresser, Desk Lamp (not in view)
3. Action: go to dresser 1
State 9:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 5
2. Objects: Alarm Clock, Desk Lamp (not visible)
3. Action: put alarmclock 2 in/on shelf 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to bed 1
(2): go to dresser 1
(3): go to drawer 1
(4): go to drawer 2
(5): go to drawer 3
(6): go to drawer 4
(7): go to drawer 5
(8): go to garbagecan 1
(9): go to drawer 6
(10): go to drawer 7
(11): go to drawer 8
(12): go to drawer 9
(13): go to drawer 10
(14): go to shelf 2
(15): go to shelf 3
(16): go to shelf 4
(17): go to shelf 5
(18): go to shelf 6
(19): go to shelf 7
(20): examine alarmclock 2

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to position the alarm clock under the light of the desk lamp. The historical data shows that the alarm clock has been taken from the shelf, but the desk lamp is not in view in the current observation. The only object related to the task in the current observation is the alarm clock, which we have already picked up. Since the desk lamp is not visible, we cannot complete the current step with the current observation. Therefore, we need to move to a location where the desk lamp is visible. None of the admissible actions directly suggest interacting with the desk lamp or positioning the alarm clock under it. However, we do have actions to "go to dresser 1" which is the last known location where we interacted with the alarm clock and the dresser. We should try moving back to the dresser to see if it gives us a better view of the desk lamp.

The Most Appropriate Action: (2): go to dresser 1

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

**Context**
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to position the alarm clock under the light of the desk lamp. The historical data shows that the alarm clock has been taken from the shelf, but the desk lamp is not in view in the current observation. The only object related to the task in the current observation is the alarm clock, which we have already picked up.
