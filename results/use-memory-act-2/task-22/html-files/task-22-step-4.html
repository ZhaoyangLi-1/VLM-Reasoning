VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to heat some egg and put it in countertop. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find an egg.
2. Pick up the egg.
3. Find a microwave.
4. Heat the egg with the microwave.
5. Find a countertop.
6. Place the heated egg on the countertop.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
State 1:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Sink, Faucet, Sponge, Soap Dispenser
3. Action: go to fridge 1

3. Action: take bread 1 from fridge 1
State 4:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 2
2. Objects: Bread Loaf, Lettuce, Bowl, Two Potatoes
3. Action: go to microwave 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to cabinet 1
(2): go to cabinet 2
(3): go to countertop 1
(4): go to cabinet 3
(5): go to cabinet 4
(6): go to cabinet 5

(40): open microwave 1
(41): close microwave 1
(42): put bread 1 in/on microwave 1
(43): heat bread 1 with microwave 1
(44): examine bread 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: According to the history, the agent has picked up bread instead of an egg and has moved to the microwave. The current observation shows that the agent is in front of the microwave. The visible objects related to the task in the current observation are the microwave, bread loaf, knife, and fork. Since the agent has bread instead of an egg and the plan requires an egg to be heated, we need to correct the mistake by finding and picking up an egg. However, none of the admissible actions involve finding or picking up an egg directly. The most appropriate action should then be to go back to the fridge where eggs are typically stored.

The Most Appropriate Action: (39): go to fridge 1

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

**Context**
