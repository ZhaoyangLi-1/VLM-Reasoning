VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to put a laptop in desk. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a credit card.
2. Pick up the credit card.
3. Locate an armchair.
4. Place the credit card on the armchair.

**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to bed 1
(2): go to garbagecan 1
(3): go to desk 1
(4): go to drawer 1
(5): go to drawer 2
(6): go to laundryhamper 1
(7): go to drawer 3
(8): go to drawer 4
(9): open drawer 5
(10): take alarmclock 1 from drawer 5
(11): take laundryhamperlid 1 from drawer 5
(12): take alarmclock 2 from drawer 5
(13): take cellphone 1 from drawer 5
(14): take creditcard 1 from drawer 5

(16): take pencil 1 from drawer 5
(17): take pencil 2 from drawer 5
(18): take keychain 1 from drawer 5
(19): use desklamp 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to place the laptop on the desk (step 12), and our current place is in front of the desk with a laptop visible on it. In the current observation, we can see the desk, a laptop, an alarm clock, a cellphone, and writing utensils. Given that the laptop is already on the desk, we can consider step 12 complete without further action. However, as there is no action to end the task in the admissible actions list, we should choose an action that maintains the current state without altering it. Therefore, staying in place would be the most appropriate action, but since such an action is not listed, the closest to maintaining the current state would be to interact with an object that does not change the completion of the task. 

The Most Appropriate Action: (19): use desklamp 1

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

**Context**
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to place the laptop on the desk (step 12), and our current place is in front of the desk with a laptop visible on it. In the current observation, we can see the desk, a laptop, an alarm clock, a cellphone, and writing utensils. Given that the laptop is already on the desk, we can consider step 12 complete without further action.
