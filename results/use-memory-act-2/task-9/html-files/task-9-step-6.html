VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to put some soapbottle on toilet. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a soap bottle.
2. Pick up the soap bottle.
3. Find a toilet.
4. Place the picked-up soap bottle on the toilet.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
State 1:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Bathroom, Sink, Mirror, Toilet (partial view)
3. Action: go to cabinet 1
State 2:
1. Step Index in the Plan: Unknown
2. Objects: Bathroom, Sinks, Countertop, Soap Bottle
3. Action: go to countertop 1
State 3:
2. Step Index in the Plan: 2
3. Objects: Soap Bottle, Countertop, Mirror (reflection)
3. Action: take faucet 1 from countertop 1
State 4:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 2
2. Objects: Sink, Mirror, Soap Bottle (reflected in the mirror, behind us)
3. Action: go to toilet 1
State 5:
2. Step Index in the Plan: 4
3. Objects: Soap Bottle, Cabinet, Sink, Toilet
4. Action: put faucet 1 in/on toilet 1
State 6:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 4
2. Objects: Soap Bottle, Cabinet, Sink, Toilet
3. Action: examine faucet 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to bathtub 1
(2): go to bathtubbasin 1
(3): go to cabinet 1
(4): go to cabinet 2
(5): go to cabinet 3
(6): go to sink 1
(7): go to sink 2
(8): go to countertop 1
(9): go to cabinet 4
(10): go to sinkbasin 1
(11): go to sinkbasin 2
(12): go to toiletpaperhanger 1
(13): go to towelholder 1
(14): go to garbagecan 1
(15): go to handtowelholder 1
(16): examine faucet 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current observation shows the soap bottle on top of a cabinet next to the sink, with the toilet visible in the background. Based on the history information, the agent has already found the soap bottle (Step 1) and picked it up (Step 2). The agent then went to the toilet (Step 3) but mistakenly planned to place a faucet on the toilet instead of the soap bottle. The agent needs to correct this and complete Step 4 of the plan, which is to place the picked-up soap bottle on the toilet. Since the soap bottle is already in the agent's possession and the toilet is visible in the current observation, the agent can complete the task without needing to move to another location.

The Most Appropriate Action: (4): go to cabinet 2. 

This action may seem counterintuitive given the task is to place the soap bottle on the toilet, but based on the history, the agent has already picked up the wrong item (faucet 1) and now needs to pick up the correct item (soap bottle). Since the soap bottle is on top of cabinet 1 in the current observation, the action to "go to cabinet 2" seems to be an error in the admissible actions list. However, as it's the closest related action, it's chosen with the assumption that it's a typographical error and should actually be "go to cabinet 1" where the soap bottle is located. If the action "go to cabinet 1" was intended to be in the admissible actions, it would be the correct choice to allow the agent to pick up the soap bottle and then place it on the toilet.

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1
