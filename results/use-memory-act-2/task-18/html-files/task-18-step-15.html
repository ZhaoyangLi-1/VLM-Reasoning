2. Pick up the pot.
3. Find a fridge.
4. Cool the pot with the fridge.
5. Find a cabinet.
6. Place the cooled pot in the cabinet.

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current observation shows the agent looking at upper closed cabinets. Based on the historical data, the agent has been attempting to place the cooled pot in a cabinet, specifically cabinet 6, but the action to open it was followed by the action to close it. The current step in the plan is to place the cooled pot in the cabinet, but the image does not show the pot, and the cabinet appears to be closed. Since the historical data indicates that the agent has already cooled the pot and is at the step of placing it in the cabinet, the agent needs to open the correct cabinet to proceed. However, the current observation does not provide information about the location of the cooled pot, which is necessary to complete the current step. The agent may need to locate the cooled pot before proceeding to open the correct cabinet to place it inside.

The Most Appropriate Action: (6): go to countertop 1

This action is chosen with the assumption that the cooled pot may have been placed on a countertop after being cooled, as no specific action of picking up the cooled pot was mentioned in the historical data. Since the current observation does not provide visibility of the pot, the agent should go to the countertop to locate the pot before attempting to open a cabinet to place it inside.

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1
