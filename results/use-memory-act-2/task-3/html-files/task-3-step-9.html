VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to examine the plate with the floorlamp. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a plate.
2. Pick up the plate.
3. Find a floorlamp.
4. Turn on the floorlamp.
5. Hold the plate under the light of the floorlamp to examine it.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
State 1:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: TV Stand
3. Action: go to coffeetable 1
State 2:
1. Step Index in the Plan: Not specified, but involves picking up a plate
2. Objects: Coffee Table, Plate
3. Action: take plate 1 from coffeetable 1
State 3:
Step Index in the Plan: 3
Objects: Floorlamp, Sofa
Action: use floorlamp 1
State 4:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 4
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Sofa, Plate
3. Action: examine plate 1
State 5:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 4
2. Objects: Sofa, Floorlamp
3. Action: go to sofa 1
State 6:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 6 (presumably, based on context)
2. Objects: Sofa, Plate (previously collected)
3. Action: go to sofa 1
State 7:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 4
2. Objects: Sofa, Plate, Floorlamp
3. Action: put plate 1 in/on sofa 1
State 8:
2. Step Index in the Plan: 5
3. Objects: Sofa, Plate (in agent's possession)
4. Action: examine plate 1
State 9:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 5
2. Objects: Sofa, Plate (in agent's possession), Floorlamp
3. Action: go to sofa 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to armchair 1
(2): go to garbagecan 1
(3): go to tvstand 1
(4): go to shelf 1
(5): go to shelf 2
(6): go to sofa 1
(7): go to coffeetable 1
(8): go to sidetable 1
(9): go to sidetable 2
(10): go to drawer 1
(11): go to shelf 3
(12): go to shelf 4
(13): go to shelf 5
(14): examine sofa 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to examine the plate under the light of the floorlamp. From the current observation, the agent is holding the plate, and the sofa is visible. However, the floorlamp is not visible in the current observation, which indicates that the agent is not in the correct position to examine the plate under the floorlamp's light. Based on the history, the agent has previously interacted with the sofa and the floorlamp, and the last action was to go to sofa 1, which suggests the agent is currently near the sofa. To complete the current step, the agent needs to position itself so that the floorlamp is within its field of view. None of the admissible actions directly involve the floorlamp, so the agent must choose an action that could potentially bring the floorlamp into view. 

The Most Appropriate Action: (6): go to sofa 1

This action is chosen with the assumption that the floorlamp is near the sofa, as indicated by the history information. By going to the sofa, the agent may be able to adjust its position to bring the floorlamp into its field of view and then examine the plate under the light.

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

**Context**
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to examine the plate under the light of the floorlamp. From the current observation, the agent is holding the plate, and the sofa is visible. However, the floorlamp is not visible in the current observation, which indicates that the agent is not in the correct position to examine the plate under the floorlamp's light. Based on the history, the agent has previously interacted with the sofa and the floorlamp, and the last action was to go to sofa 1, which suggests the agent is currently near the sofa.

This action is chosen with the assumption that the floorlamp is near the sofa, as indicated by the history information. By going to the sofa, the agent may be able to adjust its position to bring the floorlamp into its field of view and then examine the plate under the light.

Please summarize the context by following above examples when providing the summary, and ensure that only the summary is included, without any extra explanation.

**Summary**

Summarization Response:
1. Step Index in the Plan: Unknown, currently need to examine the plate under the floorlamp's light
