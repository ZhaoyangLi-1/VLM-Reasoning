VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to examine the plate with the floorlamp. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a plate.
2. Pick up the plate.
3. Find a floorlamp.
4. Turn on the floorlamp.
5. Hold the plate under the light of the floorlamp to examine it.

**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to garbagecan 1
(2): go to tvstand 1
(3): go to shelf 1
(4): go to shelf 2
(5): go to sofa 1
(6): go to coffeetable 1
(7): go to sidetable 1
(8): go to sidetable 2
(9): go to drawer 1
(10): go to shelf 3
(11): go to shelf 4
(12): go to shelf 5
(13): put plate 1 in/on armchair 1
(14): examine plate 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: According to the plan, the current step is to examine the plate under the light of the floorlamp. However, the floorlamp is not observed in the current observation. The visible objects related to the task are an armchair, a garbage can, and a coffee table. The plate is held by the agent as per the historical data. Since the floorlamp is not visible in the current observation, we cannot complete the current step. The most appropriate action is to find and go towards the floorlamp, but since there is no direct action to "go to floorlamp," we must choose an action that could potentially bring the floorlamp into view. Reviewing the admissible actions, none directly relate to finding the floorlamp. However, based on previous history states where the floorlamp was mentioned, it seems the floorlamp is near the sofa. The action "go to sofa 1" has been repeatedly taken in previous states in an attempt to interact with the floorlamp. Therefore, our best course of action is to move towards the sofa in hopes of bringing the floorlamp into view.

The Most Appropriate Action: (5): go to sofa 1

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

**Context**
Analysis: According to the plan, the current step is to examine the plate under the light of the floorlamp. However, the floorlamp is not observed in the current observation. The visible objects related to the task are an armchair, a garbage can, and a coffee table. The plate is held by the agent as per the historical data. Since the floorlamp is not visible in the current observation, we cannot complete the current step.
