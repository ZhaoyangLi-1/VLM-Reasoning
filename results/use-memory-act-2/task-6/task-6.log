Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

**Context**

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current observation shows that we are facing a sidetable with two cellphones and a credit card on it. According to the history information, the previous action taken was "go to sidetable 1". Since the plan is to put a CD on the safe and we have already located a CD on a sidetable in the previous step, we are currently at step 2 of the plan which is to pick up the CD. However, the current observation does not show the CD on the sidetable, which implies it may be out of the field of view or on a different sidetable. None of the admissible actions include picking up a CD, so we need to locate the CD again. The most appropriate next action would be to go to the other sidetable in the room to check for the CD.

The Most Appropriate Action: (6): go to sidetable 2

VLM Response:
Analysis: Based on the current observation and the history information provided, the agent has previously gone to sidetable 1 and sidetable 2. In the current observation, the agent is near a sidetable with a lamp and a cellphone visible. The plan requires us to find a CD and then pick it up. Since the history states that there was a CD at sidetable 1 and the current observation does not show a CD, our current step in the plan is to pick up the CD. We can conclude that we are near sidetable 2 because the cellphone and credit card were observed there previously. To complete the current step, we need to go back to sidetable 1 where the CD was seen. Hence, the most appropriate action to take is to go to sidetable 1.

The objects related to the task in the current observation are the safe and the CD. Based on the history and current observation, we can complete the current step of placing the CD on or in the safe. The most appropriate action to take would be to go to the safe and then place the CD inside it or on it. 

The Most Appropriate Action: (17): go to safe 1

Analysis: Based on the current observation and history information, we have located the CD and picked it up (Step 2 completed). We have also found the safe (Step 3 completed). The current observation shows the safe and the CD in our possession. Given that we are at Step 4 of the plan, which is to place the picked-up CD on or in the safe, and the safe is visible in the current observation, we can complete this step without needing to move to another location. The most appropriate action here is to place the CD in or on the safe.

**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

VLM Response:
Analysis: According to the plan, we are currently at step 4, which is to place the picked-up CD on or in the safe. In the current observation, we can see the CD, the safe, and other objects such as a bowl and a pen, but these are not relevant to our task. Since the history shows that we have already picked up the CD and moved to the safe, the next logical action is to place the CD inside the safe. However, the safe appears to be closed. Therefore, we must open the safe before we can place the CD inside it.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current observation shows the agent in front of a dresser with a safe, a CD, a bowl, and a pen. According to the historical data, the agent has picked up the CD and is now at step 4 of the plan, which is to place the CD on or in the safe. The safe appears to be closed as there is no indication in the historical data or current observation that it has been opened recently. The most appropriate next action is to open the safe to proceed with placing the CD inside it, but since the action "open safe 1" is not listed in the admissible actions, the next logical step would be to put the CD in or on the safe, assuming it is open or can be placed on top of it.

Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current observation shows the agent is in front of a safe with a CD on the dresser, a bowl, and a pen. Based on the history, the agent has already picked up a CD (Step 2) and found a safe (Step 3). The agent also previously attempted to put the CD in/on the safe but seems to have examined the CD instead. With the CD visible on the dresser and the safe in the immediate vicinity, the agent is at Step 4 of the plan. The most appropriate action now is to place the CD in or on the safe. However, the admissible actions do not include "put cd 1 in/on safe 1," which indicates that the CD might not be in the agent's possession currently. The last known action with the CD was to examine it, not to pick it up. The agent needs to pick up the CD before proceeding. Since the "pick up cd 1" action is not listed, the next best action is to approach the CD's location.

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: Based on the history and current observation, we are currently at step 4 of the plan, which is to place the picked-up CD on or in the safe. The current observation reveals an open safe, a CD, a bowl, and a pen on a dresser. The history indicates that we have already picked up the CD and have attempted to put the CD in/on the safe multiple times. Since the safe is open and the CD is present, we are in a position to complete step 4. The most appropriate action is to place the CD in or on the safe.

The Most Appropriate Action: (19): put cd 1 in/on safe 1

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1
