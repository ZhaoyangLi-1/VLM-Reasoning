VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to put some cd on safe. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.

**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to bed 1
(2): go to dresser 1
(3): go to bed 2
(4): go to sidetable 1
(5): go to drawer 1
(6): go to drawer 2
(7): go to sidetable 2
(8): go to drawer 3
(9): go to drawer 4
(10): go to desk 1
(11): go to garbagecan 1
(12): go to drawer 5
(13): go to drawer 6
(14): go to drawer 7
(15): go to drawer 8
(16): go to drawer 9
(17): go to drawer 10
(18): go to drawer 11
(19): put cd 1 in/on safe 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current observation shows the agent in front of a dresser with a safe, a CD, a bowl, and a pen. According to the historical data, the agent has picked up the CD and is now at step 4 of the plan, which is to place the CD on or in the safe. The safe appears to be closed as there is no indication in the historical data or current observation that it has been opened recently. The most appropriate next action is to open the safe to proceed with placing the CD inside it, but since the action "open safe 1" is not listed in the admissible actions, the next logical step would be to put the CD in or on the safe, assuming it is open or can be placed on top of it.

The Most Appropriate Action: (19): put cd 1 in/on safe 1

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

**Context**
Analysis: The current observation shows the agent in front of a dresser with a safe, a CD, a bowl, and a pen. According to the historical data, the agent has picked up the CD and is now at step 4 of the plan, which is to place the CD on or in the safe. The safe appears to be closed as there is no indication in the historical data or current observation that it has been opened recently. The most appropriate next action is to open the safe to proceed with placing the CD inside it, but since the action "open safe 1" is not listed in the admissible actions, the next logical step would be to put the CD in or on the safe, assuming it is open or can be placed on top of it.

The Most Appropriate Action: (19): put cd 1 in/on safe 1

Please summarize the context by following above examples when providing the summary, and ensure that only the summary is included, without any extra explanation.
