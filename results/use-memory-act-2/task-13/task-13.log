VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to put a clean tomato in garbagecan. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a tomato.
2. Pick up the tomato.
3. Find a sink or basin.
4. Clean the tomato with the sink or basin.
5. Find a garbage can.
6. Place the cleaned tomato in the garbage can.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.

(4): go to cabinet 3
(5): go to garbagecan 1
(6): go to cabinet 4
(7): go to toaster 1
(8): go to sinkbasin 1
(9): go to fridge 1
(10): go to sink 1
(11): go to cabinet 5
(12): go to microwave 1
(13): go to countertop 2
(14): go to cabinet 6
(15): go to cabinet 7
(16): go to drawer 1

(25): go to cabinet 10
(26): go to cabinet 11
(27): go to diningtable 1
(28): go to drawer 3

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: As there is no history available, we are at the first step of our plan, which is to find a tomato. In the current observation, we can see a sink basin, a countertop, and a garbage can, but there is no tomato visible. Since we cannot complete the first step with the current observation, we need to move to a different location to find a tomato. The most logical places to find a tomato would be in the fridge or on a countertop.

The Most Appropriate Action: (9): go to fridge 1

**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

VLM Response:
Analysis: Based on the history information, the agent's last known action was to go to the fridge, which correlates with step 1 of the plan: "Find a tomato." However, the current observation does not provide any visual information on the surroundings, as the image is too dark to discern any objects. Without any visible objects related to the task, we cannot determine if the agent is currently in a position to complete step 1. To proceed, the agent should attempt to find the tomato which may be stored in the fridge. Therefore, the most appropriate action to take next would be to open the fridge if it's not already open.

The Most Appropriate Action: (28): open fridge 1

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to clean the tomato with the sink or basin, and our current place appears to be near a sink and a garbage can. In the current observation, the visible objects related to the task are a sink basin and a garbage can. Based on the history, we have already picked up the tomato and are now at the sink basin, ready to clean the tomato. We can complete the current step with the objects in the current observation. The most appropriate action is to clean the tomato with the sinkbasin.

The Most Appropriate Action: (29): clean tomato 1 with sinkbasin 1

**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1

**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to put a clean tomato in garbagecan. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a tomato.
2. Pick up the tomato.
3. Find a sink or basin.
4. Clean the tomato with the sink or basin.
5. Find a garbage can.
6. Place the cleaned tomato in the garbage can.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to place the cleaned tomato in the garbage can, as we have already located and cleaned the tomato. In the current observation, we can see the tomato, a sink basin, and a garbage can. Since the tomato has been cleaned as per the previous action (clean tomato 1 with sinkbasin 1), we can proceed to the next step of placing the cleaned tomato in the garbage can. The Most Appropriate Action: (5): go to garbagecan 1.
