VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to put a cool pan in stoveburner. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a pan.
2. Pick up the pan.
3. Find a fridge.
4. Cool the pan with the fridge.
5. Find a stove burner.
6. Place the cooled pan on the stove burner.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>
Objects in The Image: ['microwave oven', 'tweezers', 'salt shaker', 'paper towels', 'wooden cabinets']

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
State 0:
No history.
State 1:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Kitchen Sink, Faucet, Cup, Neti Pot
3. Action: go to cabinet 1
State 2:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Wooden Floor (no other objects visible)
3. Action: go to cabinet 2
State 3:
1. Step Index in the Plan: Unknown
2. Objects: Wooden Door, Cabinets, Drawers
3. Action: go to cabinet 4


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to cabinet 3
(2): go to countertop 1
(3): go to cabinet 5
(4): go to microwave 1
(5): go to cabinet 6
(6): go to drawer 1
(7): go to drawer 2
(8): go to drawer 3
(9): go to cabinet 7
(10): go to cabinet 8
(11): go to sink 1
(12): go to sinkbasin 1
(13): go to coffeemachine 1
(14): go to cabinet 9
(15): go to cabinet 10
(16): go to drawer 4
(17): go to cabinet 11
(18): go to stoveburner 1
(19): go to stoveburner 2
(20): go to stoveburner 3
(21): go to stoveburner 4
(22): go to cabinet 12
(23): go to toaster 1
(24): go to drawer 5
(25): go to countertop 2
(26): go to fridge 1
(27): go to cabinet 13
(28): go to cabinet 14
(29): go to diningtable 1
(30): go to garbagecan 1
(31): go to safe 1
(32): open cabinet 4
(33): close cabinet 4

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to find a pan, which corresponds to step 1. The current place appears to be a kitchen with a countertop and several wooden cabinets. The objects visible in the current observation are a microwave oven, tweezers, a salt shaker, paper towels, and wooden cabinets. None of these objects is a pan. Based on the history, the agent has previously attempted to find a pan by going to different cabinets but has not yet located one. Given that the cabinets observed in the previous states did not contain a pan, and the current view does not show a pan, the agent should continue searching the cabinets for a pan. Since we are required to complete each step in order and cannot skip steps, the most appropriate action is to continue searching the cabinets.

The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to cabinet 3

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

**Context**
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to find a pan, which corresponds to step 1. The current place appears to be a kitchen with a countertop and several wooden cabinets. The objects visible in the current observation are a microwave oven, tweezers, a salt shaker, paper towels, and wooden cabinets. None of these objects is a pan.
