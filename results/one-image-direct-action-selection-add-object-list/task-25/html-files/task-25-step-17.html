VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to find two dishsponge and put them in cart. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a dish sponge.
2. Pick up the dish sponge.
3. Find a cart.
4. Place the picked-up dish sponge in the cart.
5. Find another dish sponge.
6. Pick up the dish sponge.
7. Return to the previously located cart.
8. Place the second picked-up dish sponge in the cart with the first one.

**Current Observation**

**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to bathtub 1
(2): go to cart 1
(3): go to toilet 1
(4): go to garbagecan 1
(5): go to toiletpaperhanger 1
(6): go to shelf 2
(7): go to shelf 4
(8): go to sink 1
(9): go to sinkbasin 1
(10): go to handtowelholder 1
(11): put cloth 1 in/on shelf 3
(12): examine cloth 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: According to the history, the agent has already completed up to step 4 of the plan, which involved placing the first dish sponge in the cart. The current step in the plan is step 5: Find another dish sponge. In the current observation, we see a white shelving unit with various objects including a pink soap and an empty toilet paper roll. There is also a brown object on the shelf, which could potentially be a dish sponge, and a black crumpled towel on the floor. None of the objects listed in the observation or visible in the image are identified as a dish sponge, and no sponges are clearly visible. Hence, the current observation does not allow us to complete step 5. We must continue to search for another dish sponge. The most appropriate action to take next would be to go to another location where a dish sponge might be found.

Given the admissible actions and the history that has led us to various shelves and the bathtub without finding a second dish sponge, we could consider checking another spot that has not been mentioned in the recent history, like shelf 4 or the sink, which might hold a dish sponge typically used for dishwashing. Since "go to shelf 4" is in the admissible actions and the current shelf (presumably shelf 3) does not contain a dish sponge, we should try that next.

The Most Appropriate Action: (7): go to shelf 4

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

**Context**

The current step in the plan is step 5: Find another dish sponge. In the current observation, we see a white shelving unit with various objects including a pink soap and an empty toilet paper roll.
