VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to find two dishsponge and put them in cart. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a dish sponge.
2. Pick up the dish sponge.
3. Find a cart.
4. Place the picked-up dish sponge in the cart.
5. Find another dish sponge.
6. Pick up the dish sponge.
7. Return to the previously located cart.
8. Place the second picked-up dish sponge in the cart with the first one.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>
Objects in The Image: ['towel rack', 'black clothing', 'sponge', 'toilet paper roll']

1. Step Index in the Plan: 2
2. Objects: Bathtub, Black Cloth Object, (not explicitly mentioned Dish Sponge)
3. Action: take dishsponge 1 from bathtub 1
State 8:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 3
2. Objects: Bathtub, Green Sponge (dish sponge), Cart
3. Action: go to cart 1
State 9:
1. Step Index in the Plan: Uncertain, but likely a step involving placing an item in a cart
2. Objects: Green Soap, Black Sponge (dish sponge), Toilet Paper Roll, Cart
3. Action: put dishsponge 1 in/on cart 1
State 10:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 5
2. Objects: Metal Rack (Cart), Yellow Sponge, Toilet Paper Roll, Black Piece of Clothing
3. Action: go to shelf 4


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to bathtub 1
(2): go to bathtubbasin 1
(3): go to toilet 1
(4): go to garbagecan 1
(5): go to toiletpaperhanger 1
(6): go to shelf 1
(7): go to shelf 2
(8): go to shelf 3
(9): go to shelf 4
(10): go to sink 1
(11): go to sinkbasin 1
(12): go to handtowelholder 1
(13): take cloth 1 from cart 1
(14): take toiletpaper 2 from cart 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: According to the plan, the agent has already placed the first dish sponge in the cart, which corresponds to step 4. The next step (step 5) is to find another dish sponge. The current observation shows a cart with a black piece of clothing and a yellow sponge, which is identified as a dish sponge. Since the objective is to find a second dish sponge and one is visible in the current observation, we can complete step 5 without moving. 

The Most Appropriate Action: (13): take cloth 1 from cart 1

This action is chosen because it seems to be a misinterpretation of the object. The yellow sponge is labeled as 'cloth,' but based on the plan and previous steps, it is likely intended to be the dish sponge we need to pick up. Taking this "cloth" from the cart will allow us to proceed with the next step of the plan, which is to pick up the dish sponge.

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

**Context**
Analysis: According to the plan, the agent has already placed the first dish sponge in the cart, which corresponds to step 4. The next step (step 5) is to find another dish sponge. The current observation shows a cart with a black piece of clothing and a yellow sponge, which is identified as a dish sponge. Since the objective is to find a second dish sponge and one is visible in the current observation, we can complete step 5 without moving. 

The Most Appropriate Action: (13): take cloth 1 from cart 1

This action is chosen because it seems to be a misinterpretation of the object.

Taking this "cloth" from the cart will allow us to proceed with the next step of the plan, which is to pick up the dish sponge.

Please summarize the context by following above examples when providing the summary, and ensure that only the summary is included, without any extra explanation.
