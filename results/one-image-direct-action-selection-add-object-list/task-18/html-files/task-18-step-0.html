VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to put a cool pot in cabinet. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a pot.
2. Pick up the pot.
3. Find a fridge.
4. Cool the pot with the fridge.
5. Find a cabinet.
6. Place the cooled pot in the cabinet.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>
Objects in The Image: ['coffee machine', 'coffee cup', 'kitchen sink', 'drinking glass', 'egg', 'apple', 'avocado', 'lettuce', 'cabinet', 'drawer handle']

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
No history.

**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to cabinet 1
(2): go to cabinet 2
(3): go to cabinet 3
(4): go to cabinet 4
(5): go to cabinet 5
(6): go to cabinet 6
(7): go to countertop 1
(8): go to coffeemachine 1
(9): go to cabinet 7
(10): go to toaster 1
(11): go to cabinet 8
(12): go to sink 1
(13): go to fridge 1
(14): go to microwave 1
(15): go to garbagecan 1
(16): go to cabinet 9
(17): go to cabinet 10
(18): go to countertop 2
(19): go to cabinet 11
(20): go to cabinet 12
(21): go to drawer 1
(22): go to countertop 3
(23): go to drawer 2
(24): go to cabinet 13
(25): go to sinkbasin 1
(26): go to cabinet 14
(27): go to drawer 3
(28): go to stoveburner 1
(29): go to stoveburner 2
(30): go to stoveburner 3
(31): go to cabinet 15
(32): go to stoveburner 4
(33): go to cabinet 16
(34): go to cabinet 17
(35): go to cabinet 18
(36): go to cabinet 19
(37): go to cabinet 20
(38): go to shelf 1
(39): go to shelf 2
(40): go to shelf 3

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current observation shows a kitchen sink with various items, but no pot is visible. As there is no history available, we are at the first step of the plan, which is to find a pot. The visible objects related to the task in the current observation are the 'kitchen sink', 'cabinet', and 'drawer handle'. However, none of these objects are the pot we need to find. To proceed with the plan, we should look for the pot in typical storage places like cabinets or drawers. Among the admissible actions, those involving going to a cabinet are the most relevant because pots are usually stored in cabinets rather than on countertops or appliances.

The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to cabinet 1

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1
