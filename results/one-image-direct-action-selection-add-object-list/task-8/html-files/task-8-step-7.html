VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to put a laptop in desk. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a laptop.
2. Pick up the laptop.
3. Find a desk.
4. Place the picked-up laptop on the desk.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>
Objects in The Image: ['desk', 'chair with blue cushion', 'lamp', 'analog clock', 'two pens', 'smartphone', 'wastebasket', 'air conditioning unit', 'window']

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
State 0:
No history.
State 1:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Mirror, Door, Light Switch, Trash Can, Carpet, Table, Magazine, CD
3. Action: go to desk 1
State 2:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Desk, Alarm Clock, Pencils, Smartphone
3. Action: go to drawer 1
State 3:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Bed, Plush Panda, Nightstand, CD, Book
3. Action: open drawer 1
State 4:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 2
2. Objects: Mirror, Nightstand, CD, Blue Book
3. Action: go to drawer 4
State 5:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 2
2. Objects: Desk, Chair, Table Lamp, Clock, Smartphone, Pen, Air Conditioner, Trash Can, Window
3. Action: open drawer 4
State 6:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 2
2. Objects: Desk, Lamp, Clock, Pen, Ruler, Smartphone, Open Drawer (no laptop visible)
3. Action: close drawer 4
State 7:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Desk, Chair, Lamp, Clock, Ruler, Smartphone, Trash Can, Air Conditioner, Window
3. Action: go to drawer 5


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to bed 1
(2): go to garbagecan 1
(3): go to desk 1
(4): go to sidetable 1
(5): go to drawer 1
(6): go to drawer 2
(7): go to laundryhamper 1
(8): go to drawer 3
(9): go to drawer 4
(10): open drawer 5
(11): close drawer 5

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to find a laptop, which corresponds to step 1. We are currently located at desk 5, as indicated by the history and the objects in the current observation, which match the description of the desk area seen in the history. The visible objects related to the task in the current observation are a desk, a chair with a blue cushion, a lamp, an analog clock, two pens, a smartphone, a wastebasket, an air conditioning unit, and a window. There is no laptop visible in the current observation. Since we have already opened drawer 4 and did not find the laptop, and the history indicates we have moved on to drawer 5, the next logical step according to the plan is to open drawer 5 to continue searching for the laptop. This matches with the admissible actions available.

The Most Appropriate Action: (10): open drawer 5

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

**Context**
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to find a laptop, which corresponds to step 1. We are currently located at desk 5, as indicated by the history and the objects in the current observation, which match the description of the desk area seen in the history. The visible objects related to the task in the current observation are a desk, a chair with a blue cushion, a lamp, an analog clock, two pens, a smartphone, a wastebasket, an air conditioning unit, and a window. There is no laptop visible in the current observation. Since we have already opened drawer 4 and did not find the laptop, and the history indicates we have moved on to drawer 5, the next logical step according to the plan is to open drawer 5 to continue searching for the laptop. This matches with the admissible actions available.

The Most Appropriate Action: (10): open drawer 5

Please summarize the context by following above examples when providing the summary, and ensure that only the summary is included, without any extra explanation.
