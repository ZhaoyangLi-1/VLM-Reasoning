VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to look at alarmclock under the desklamp. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find an alarm clock.
2. Pick up the alarm clock.
3. Locate a desklamp.
4. Turn on the desklamp.
5. Position the alarm clock under the desklamp so that it is illuminated.
6. Look at the illuminated alarm clock to complete the task.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>
Objects in The Image: ['bed', 'pillow', 'bedside table', 'lamp', 'picture frame']

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
State 0:
No history.
State 1:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Bedside Table, Lamp
3. Action: go to sidetable 1
State 2:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 2
2. Objects: Bedside Table, Lamp
3. Action: go to drawer 1
State 3:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 2
2. Objects: Bedside Table, Lamp
3. Action: open drawer 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to bed 1
(2): go to dresser 1
(3): go to drawer 2
(4): go to drawer 3
(5): go to drawer 4
(6): go to drawer 5
(7): go to drawer 6
(8): go to drawer 7
(9): go to drawer 8
(10): go to drawer 9
(11): go to drawer 10
(12): go to drawer 11
(13): go to safe 1
(14): go to laundryhamper 1
(15): go to garbagecan 1
(16): close drawer 1
(17): take pillow 1 from drawer 1
(18): take cellphone 1 from drawer 1
(19): take pencil 1 from drawer 1
(20): use desklamp 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: Based on the provided plan and historical information, we have already located the bedside table and opened drawer 1. Since the current step in the plan is to pick up the alarm clock, we need to locate it. The current observation shows the bedside table with an open drawer, but the image does not provide a view of the contents inside the drawer. However, from the history information, we know that drawer 1 has been opened, and the admissible actions suggest that there are items to take from this drawer. Since alarm clocks are commonly stored in bedside table drawers, it's likely that the alarm clock we are tasked to find is inside drawer 1. The objects that are visible and related to our task in the current observation are a lamp and a bedside table. To proceed with the next step, we should attempt to take the alarm clock from the drawer, assuming it is there.

The Most Appropriate Action: (17): take alarmclock 1 from drawer 1

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

**Context**
Analysis: Based on the provided plan and historical information, we have already located the bedside table and opened drawer 1. Since the current step in the plan is to pick up the alarm clock, we need to locate it. The current observation shows the bedside table with an open drawer, but the image does not provide a view of the contents inside the drawer. However, from the history information, we know that drawer 1 has been opened, and the admissible actions suggest that there are items to take from this drawer.

To proceed with the next step, we should attempt to take the alarm clock from the drawer, assuming it is there.

The Most Appropriate Action: (17): take alarmclock 1 from drawer 1

Please summarize the context by following above examples when providing the summary, and ensure that only the summary is included, without any extra explanation.
