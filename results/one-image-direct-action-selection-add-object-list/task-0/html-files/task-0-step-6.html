VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to look at alarmclock under the desklamp. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find an alarm clock.
2. Pick up the alarm clock.
3. Locate a desklamp.
4. Turn on the desklamp.
5. Position the alarm clock under the desklamp so that it is illuminated.
6. Look at the illuminated alarm clock to complete the task.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>
Objects in The Image: ['nightstand', 'lamp', 'bed', 'pillow', 'smartphone', 'wall', 'carpet', 'picture frame']

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
State 0:
No history.
State 1:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Bedside Table, Lamp
3. Action: go to sidetable 1
State 2:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 2
2. Objects: Bedside Table, Lamp
3. Action: go to drawer 1
State 3:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 2
2. Objects: Bedside Table, Lamp
3. Action: open drawer 1
State 4:
1. Step Index in the Plan: Unknown (Continuation from a previous step)
2. Objects: Lamp, Bedside Table, Open Drawer (potentially containing alarm clock)
3. Action: take alarmclock 1 from drawer 1
State 5:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 4
2. Objects: Bedside Table, Lamp (assumed desklamp), Alarm Clock (previously picked up)
3. Action: use desklamp 1
State 6:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 5
2. Objects: Alarm Clock, Desklamp, Bedside Table
3. Action: close drawer 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to bed 1
(2): go to sidetable 1
(3): go to dresser 1
(4): go to drawer 2
(5): go to drawer 3
(6): go to drawer 4
(7): go to drawer 5
(8): go to drawer 6
(9): go to drawer 7
(10): go to drawer 8
(11): go to drawer 9
(12): go to drawer 10
(13): go to drawer 11
(14): go to safe 1
(15): go to laundryhamper 1
(16): go to garbagecan 1
(17): open drawer 1
(18): take pillow 1 from drawer 1
(19): take cellphone 1 from drawer 1
(20): take pencil 1 from drawer 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: According to the plan, the current step should be positioning the alarm clock under the desklamp (step 5) because the previous action was closing the drawer, which suggests that the alarm clock had already been retrieved and the desklamp turned on. The current observation shows the nightstand with the desklamp on it, and the lamp is illuminated, indicating that the desklamp has been turned on successfully as per step 4 of the plan. Since there is no alarm clock visible in the current observation, it is likely that the agent is holding it, as the action to pick it up has been completed in the history. The task now is to position the alarm clock under the desklamp. However, none of the admissible actions directly involve placing or positioning the alarm clock. So we must choose an action that potentially allows us to interact with the desklamp or the area around it, such as the nightstand.

Since "go to sidetable 1" is synonymous with "go to nightstand," this action seems appropriate to bring the agent closer to the place where it can position the alarm clock under the desklamp. The other actions listed are unrelated to interacting with the lamp or the nightstand.

The Most Appropriate Action: (2): go to sidetable 1

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

Please summarize the context by following above examples when providing the summary, and ensure that only the summary is included, without any extra explanation.
