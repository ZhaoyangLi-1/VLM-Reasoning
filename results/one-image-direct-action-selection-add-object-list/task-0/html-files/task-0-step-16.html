VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to look at alarmclock under the desklamp. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find an alarm clock.
2. Pick up the alarm clock.
3. Locate a desklamp.
4. Turn on the desklamp.
5. Position the alarm clock under the desklamp so that it is illuminated.
6. Look at the illuminated alarm clock to complete the task.

**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to sidetable 1
(2): go to drawer 1
(3): go to dresser 1
(4): go to drawer 2
(5): go to drawer 3
(6): go to drawer 4
(7): go to drawer 5
(8): go to drawer 6
(9): go to drawer 7
(10): go to drawer 8
(11): go to drawer 9
(12): go to drawer 10
(13): go to drawer 11
(14): go to safe 1
(15): go to laundryhamper 1
(16): go to garbagecan 1
(17): put cellphone 1 in/on bed 1
(18): examine cellphone 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: Based on the current observation, we are in a room with a bed, and a bedside table on which there is a desklamp that is turned on. Also visible on the bed are a book titled "Arabian Nights," a laptop, and a smartphone. According to the history, the alarm clock was taken from the drawer (State 4) and the desklamp was turned on (State 5). The agent was instructed to close the drawer (State 6), approached the bedside table (State 7), and performed various actions related to the smartphone (States 8, 9, 10, and 14). The last action in the history involved taking the smartphone from the bed (State 14), which is unrelated to the main task.

We are currently on step 5 of the plan, which involves positioning the alarm clock under the desklamp so that it is illuminated. However, the alarm clock is not visible in the current observation. This could imply that the alarm clock is still being held by the agent since the last confirmed interaction with the alarm clock was holding it (State 12). Since the desklamp is on and the bedside table is accessible, we can proceed to complete step 5 by placing the alarm clock under the desklamp.

However, there are no actions available in the admissible actions list that directly correspond to placing the alarm clock under the desklamp. Given the constraints and available actions, the most appropriate next action would be to approach the bedside table, as this is the location where the desklamp is situated, and we can infer that the alarm clock needs to be positioned there.

The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to sidetable 1

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1
