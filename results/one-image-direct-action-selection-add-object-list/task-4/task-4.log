**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to examine the statue with the floorlamp. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a statue.
2. Pick up the statue.
3. Locate a floorlamp.
4. Turn on the floorlamp.
5. Examine the statue under the light of the floorlamp.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>
Objects in The Image: ['floor lamp', 'sofa', 'green cushion', 'brown book']

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
No history.

**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to armchair 1
(2): go to coffeetable 1
(3): go to sidetable 1
(4): go to garbagecan 1
(5): go to drawer 1
(6): go to sofa 1
(7): go to coffeetable 2
(8): go to diningtable 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to find a statue. The image shows a floor lamp, sofa, green cushion, and brown book; however, no statue is visible. Since the statue is not in the current observation, we cannot complete the current step with the information provided. Among the admissible actions, none directly suggest the presence of a statue, so we should choose an action that allows us to explore the environment further in search of the statue. Going to various furniture items may help us find the statue, as it could be placed on or near furniture. The action "go to sidetable 1" seems like a reasonable option, as side tables often serve as a place for decorative items like statues.

The Most Appropriate Action: (3): go to sidetable 1

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to pick up the statue, which corresponds to step 2 in the detailed plan. The current observation shows a statue and a pen, which means the statue we need to interact with is visible. There is no need to move to another location to find the statue as it is already in the current view. Based on the admissible actions, the only action related to the statue is to take it. Therefore, the most appropriate action to advance the plan is to take the statue from its current location.

The Most Appropriate Action: (8): take statue 1 from sidetable 1

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to pick up the statue, which corresponds to step 2. Based on the history information, this step has been completed as the action taken was "take statue 1 from sidetable 1". The current observation shows the statue in close view, indicating that the agent has the statue. Therefore, the next step in the plan is to locate a floorlamp, which is step 3. Since the current observation does not include a floorlamp, we cannot complete this step with the current observation. The most appropriate action to take would be to go to a location where a floorlamp was previously observed. Referring to the history information, a floorlamp was mentioned during State 1. However, there is no admissible action listed that directly references going to the floorlamp. The closest action that would likely lead to the location of the floorlamp based on the history is to go to the sofa since that is where objects were mentioned in the same context as the floorlamp.

The Most Appropriate Action: (5): go to sofa 1
