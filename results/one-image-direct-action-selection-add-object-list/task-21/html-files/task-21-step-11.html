VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to heat some cup and put it in countertop. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a cup.
2. Pick up the cup.
3. Find a microwave.
4. Heat the cup with the microwave.
5. Find a countertop.
6. Place the heated cup on the countertop.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>
Objects in The Image: ['cabinet', 'handle', 'shelf', 'ceiling', 'wall']

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
State 0:
No history.
State 1:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Kitchen Sink, Fork, Spoon, Faucet, Window, Trash Can, Countertop, Cabinet, Tiles
3. Action: go to cabinet 1
State 2:
2. Step Index in the Plan: 1
3. Objects: Cabinet, Cabinet Handles
4. Action: open cabinet 1
State 3:
1. Step Index in the Plan: Unknown (Current task is "Find a cup.")
2. Objects: Cabinet 1, Plate (inside cabinet)
3. Action: go to cabinet 2
State 4:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Cabinet, Shelf, Plate
3. Action: open cabinet 2
State 5:
2. Step Index in the Plan: 1
3. Objects: Cabinets, Plate
4. Action: go to cabinet 3
State 6:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Cabinet 3, Shelf, Plate
3. Action: go to cabinet 4
State 7:
1. Step Index in the Plan: Unknown
2. Objects: Kitchen Cabinet, Cabinet Handle
3. Action: open cabinet 4
State 8:
1. Step Index in the Plan: Unknown (specific step to find a cup)
2. Objects: Salt Shaker, Tiled Backsplash, Kitchen Cabinet, Countertop
3. Action: go to cabinet 5
State 9:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Salt Shaker, Kitchen Counter, Tile Backsplash, Cabinet
3. Action: open cabinet 5
State 10:
1. Step Index in the Plan: Unknown
2. Objects: Salt Shaker, Cabinet 5, Cabinet Handle, Countertop, Tile Backsplash
3. Action: go to cabinet 6
State 11:
1. Step Index in the Plan: Unknown (aim is to find a cup)
2. Objects: Refrigerator, Cabinets, Ceiling, Handles
3. Action: open cabinet 6


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to cabinet 1
(2): go to cabinet 2
(3): go to cabinet 3
(4): go to microwave 1
(5): go to cabinet 4
(6): go to cabinet 5
(7): go to countertop 1
(8): go to coffeemachine 1
(9): go to toaster 1
(10): go to countertop 2
(11): go to sink 1
(12): go to sinkbasin 1
(13): go to fridge 1
(14): close cabinet 6
(15): take plate 1 from cabinet 6

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current step in the plan involves finding a cup, which corresponds to step 1 of the plan. Based on the history information, multiple cabinets have been opened (cabinet 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6) without finding a cup. The current observation shows a view of a cabinet, but the image does not reveal whether it is open or closed, or what its contents are. The objects listed in the current observation are 'cabinet', 'handle', 'shelf', 'ceiling', and 'wall', with no mention of a cup. Therefore, we cannot complete the current step with the current observation. Since the history indicates that cabinets 1 through 6 have been interacted with, and the current observation doesn't provide new information, the next logical action would be to open cabinet 6 if it's not already open, as the last action was to go to cabinet 6. However, if cabinet 6 is already open, and since there is no action to look inside cabinet 6, the most appropriate action would be to close cabinet 6 and then proceed to a new cabinet or revisit any previous cabinets to look for a cup more thoroughly. Since no other "go to" actions for cabinets are available, and "take plate 1 from cabinet 6" implies that the cabinet is open and has a plate, the action to close cabinet 6 seems to be the most appropriate next step.

The Most Appropriate Action: (14): close cabinet 6

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1
