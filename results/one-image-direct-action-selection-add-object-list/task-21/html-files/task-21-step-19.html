VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to heat some cup and put it in countertop. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

2. Pick up the cup.
3. Find a microwave.
4. Heat the cup with the microwave.
5. Find a countertop.
6. Place the heated cup on the countertop.

**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to cabinet 1
(2): go to cabinet 2
(3): go to microwave 1
(4): go to cabinet 4
(5): go to cabinet 5
(6): go to cabinet 6
(7): go to countertop 1
(8): go to coffeemachine 1
(9): go to toaster 1
(10): go to countertop 2
(11): go to sink 1
(12): go to sinkbasin 1
(13): go to fridge 1
(14): put bowl 1 in/on cabinet 3
(15): examine bowl 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to find a cup, which has been ongoing since State 1. The current observation shows the agent facing what appears to be the underside of a vent hood with a cabinet in view. The objects in the image are a 'Vent hood', 'Cabinet', and 'Handle'. There is no cup visible in the current observation, so we cannot complete the current step with what we see now. Based on the history, cabinet 3 was the last one to have a bowl taken from it, and the previous actions included opening various cabinets and a microwave in search of a cup. Since the 'Cabinet' in the current observation has not been specified in the history as one that has already been checked and opened, examining this cabinet might be the most appropriate next action.

However, the admissible actions do not include an option to open the currently viewed cabinet; they only include "go to" actions for various locations and the option to put the bowl back or examine it. Since we have not successfully found a cup yet, examining the bowl taken from cabinet 3 (action 15) would not be productive for our current objective. Therefore, we should continue searching the cabinets.

We have actions available to go to various cabinets (1, 2, 4, 5, 6), but the history indicates that cabinets 1 through 6 have already been opened and did not contain a cup. Since there are no new cabinets listed in the admissible actions, and we cannot open the cabinet we're currently observing, the best course of action would be to revisit one of the previously opened cabinets in case the cup was missed during earlier searches.

The Most Appropriate Action: (4): go to cabinet 4

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1
