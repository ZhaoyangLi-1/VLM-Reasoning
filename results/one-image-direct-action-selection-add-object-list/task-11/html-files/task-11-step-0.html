VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to clean some soapbar and put it in bathtubbasin. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a soap bar.
2. Pick up the soap bar.
3. Find a sink or basin.
4. Clean the soap bar with the sink or basin.
5. Find a bathtub basin.
6. Place the cleaned soap bar in the bathtub basin.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>
Objects in The Image: ['spray bottle', 'toilet', 'toilet brush', 'window', 'sink', 'faucet', 'countertop']

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
No history.

**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to bathtub 1
(2): go to bathtubbasin 1
(3): go to toilet 1
(4): go to cabinet 1
(5): go to countertop 1
(6): go to sink 1
(7): go to sinkbasin 1
(8): go to cabinet 2
(9): go to garbagecan 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: There is no history available, so we are at the first step of the plan, which is to find a soap bar. Our current place is unknown, but we are observing a bathroom area with a sink visible. The objects visible in the current observation that are related to the task include a 'sink', 'faucet', and 'countertop'. Since we are at the first step of the plan, we need to find a soap bar, and it is not visible in the current observation, we cannot complete this step with the current observation. Therefore, we should look for the soap bar in locations where it is commonly found, such as countertops, cabinets, or near sinks.

The Most Appropriate Action: (4): go to cabinet 1

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

**Context**
Analysis: There is no history available, so we are at the first step of the plan, which is to find a soap bar. Our current place is unknown, but we are observing a bathroom area with a sink visible.
