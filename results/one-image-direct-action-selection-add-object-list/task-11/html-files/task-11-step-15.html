VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to clean some soapbar and put it in bathtubbasin. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a soap bar.
2. Pick up the soap bar.
3. Find a sink or basin.
4. Clean the soap bar with the sink or basin.
5. Find a bathtub basin.
6. Place the cleaned soap bar in the bathtub basin.

3. Action: go to cabinet 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to bathtub 1
(2): go to toilet 1
(3): go to countertop 1
(4): go to sink 1
(5): go to sinkbasin 1
(6): go to cabinet 2
(7): go to garbagecan 1
(8): open cabinet 1
(9): close cabinet 1
(10): put candle 2 in/on cabinet 1
(11): examine candle 2

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: Based on the history information, the agent is still at step 1 of the plan, which is to find a soap bar. The current observation shows the following objects: toilet, toilet tank, spray bottle, candle, sink, faucet, countertop, and window. The historical data indicates that the agent has previously checked cabinets 1 and 2 without finding a soap bar. Since the plan requires us to find a soap bar and there are no new objects in the current observation that suggest the presence of a soap bar, we cannot complete this step with the current observation. The best course of action seems to be to explore a new area or object that has not been checked yet. However, since all admissible actions involve going to previously observed objects or locations, the agent should perform an action that may lead to discovering new objects or areas. 

The Most Appropriate Action: (8): open cabinet 1

This action is chosen because the history indicates that cabinet 1 was previously opened but the current state of cabinet 1 is closed, so it may be worth revisiting to ensure that nothing was missed in the search for the soap bar.

>>> Refine VLM Response and Get Pure Action: open cabinet 1

This action is chosen because the history indicates that cabinet 1 was previously opened but the current state of cabinet 1 is closed, so it may be worth revisiting to ensure that nothing was missed in the search for the soap bar

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

**Context**
Analysis: Based on the history information, the agent is still at step 1 of the plan, which is to find a soap bar. The current observation shows the following objects: toilet, toilet tank, spray bottle, candle, sink, faucet, countertop, and window. The historical data indicates that the agent has previously checked cabinets 1 and 2 without finding a soap bar. Since the plan requires us to find a soap bar and there are no new objects in the current observation that suggest the presence of a soap bar, we cannot complete this step with the current observation.

However, since all admissible actions involve going to previously observed objects or locations, the agent should perform an action that may lead to discovering new objects or areas. 

The Most Appropriate Action: (8): open cabinet 1

This action is chosen because the history indicates that cabinet 1 was previously opened but the current state of cabinet 1 is closed, so it may be worth revisiting to ensure that nothing was missed in the search for the soap bar.

Please summarize the context by following above examples when providing the summary, and ensure that only the summary is included, without any extra explanation.
