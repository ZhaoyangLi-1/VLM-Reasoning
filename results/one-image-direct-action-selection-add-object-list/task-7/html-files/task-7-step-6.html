VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to put a creditcard in coffeetable. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a credit card.
2. Pick up the credit card.
3. Find a coffee table.
4. Place the picked-up credit card on the coffee table.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>
Objects in The Image: ['door', 'wall', 'light switch', 'carpet', 'wooden floor', 'coffee table', 'remote control', 'sofa']

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
State 0:
No history.
State 1:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Sofa, Remote Controls, Window, Curtains
3. Action: go to coffeetable 1
State 2:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 2
2. Objects: Sofa, Two Remote Controls, Window, Curtains
3. Action: go to coffeetable 1
State 3:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 2
2. Objects: Coffee Table, Cardboard Box, Remote Control
3. Action: take box 1 from coffeetable 1
State 4:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 4
2. Objects: Coffee Table, Remote Control, Box (potentially containing credit card)
3. Action: examine box 1
State 5:
1. Step Index in the Plan: Uncertain (credit card placement expected)
2. Objects: Coffee Table, Remote Control, Box (examined for credit card)
3. Action: (15): put box 1 in/on coffeetable 1
State 6:
1. Step Index in the Plan: Potentially 4
2. Objects: Coffee Table, Box (potentially containing credit card), Remote Control
3. Action: put box 1 in/on coffee table 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to armchair 1
(2): go to armchair 2
(3): go to dresser 1
(4): go to garbagecan 1
(5): go to cabinet 1
(6): go to drawer 1
(7): go to drawer 2
(8): go to cabinet 2
(9): go to drawer 3
(10): go to cabinet 3
(11): go to drawer 4
(12): go to cabinet 4
(13): go to sidetable 1
(14): go to sofa 1
(15): put box 1 in/on coffeetable 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current step in the plan appears to be step 4, which is to place the picked-up credit card on the coffee table. The current observation shows a coffee table with a remote control on it but no visible credit card. The history indicates that the agent has already picked up a box from the coffee table, which was believed to potentially contain the credit card. The box was then examined, and the last action taken was to put the box back on the coffee table. There is no explicit confirmation that the credit card was found within the box. However, the plan seems to have progressed as if the credit card had been found since the action to put the box back onto the coffee table was taken twice, which suggests that the agent might be at the stage of placing the credit card on the table.

Visible objects related to the task are the coffee table and the remote control. The credit card is not visible in the current observation, so we cannot confirm that it is ready to be placed on the coffee table.

Since the credit card is not visible, and the history does not confirm that the credit card was found within the box, we cannot complete step 4 of the plan with the current observation. The admissible actions do not include any that would allow for the placement of the credit card onto the coffee table, as we do not have confirmation that the agent currently possesses the credit card.

The Most Appropriate Action: (15): put box 1 in/on coffeetable 1

This action is chosen because it is the only one that pertains to interacting with the coffee table, which is where we are supposed to place the credit card. Although the card itself is not visible, the repeated action of placing the box on the table suggests that the next step should involve this box. Since the list of admissible actions does not include anything new that would allow us to search for or directly place the credit card, we must assume that the previous actions have been correct and continue with the action most closely aligned with the current step in the plan.

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

**Context**
Analysis: The current step in the plan appears to be step 4, which is to place the picked-up credit card on the coffee table. The current observation shows a coffee table with a remote control on it but no visible credit card. The history indicates that the agent has already picked up a box from the coffee table, which was believed to potentially contain the credit card. The box was then examined, and the last action taken was to put the box back on the coffee table. There is no explicit confirmation that the credit card was found within the box. However, the plan seems to have progressed as if the credit card had been found since the action to put the box back onto the coffee table was taken twice, which suggests that the agent might be at the stage of placing the credit card on the table.

Visible objects related to the task are the coffee table and the remote control. The credit card is not visible in the current observation, so we cannot confirm that it is ready to be placed on the coffee table.

Since the credit card is not visible, and the history does not confirm that the credit card was found within the box, we cannot complete step 4 of the plan with the current observation. The admissible actions do not include any that would allow for the placement of the credit card onto the coffee table, as we do not have confirmation that the agent currently possesses the credit card.

The Most Appropriate Action: (15): put box 1 in/on coffeetable 1

This action is chosen because it is the only one that pertains to interacting with the coffee table, which is where we are supposed to place the credit card. Although the card itself is not visible, the repeated action of placing the box on the table suggests that the next step should involve this box. Since the list of admissible actions does not include anything new that would allow us to search for or directly place the credit card, we must assume that the previous actions have been correct and continue with the action most closely aligned with the current step in the plan.

Please summarize the context by following above examples when providing the summary, and ensure that only the summary is included, without any extra explanation.
