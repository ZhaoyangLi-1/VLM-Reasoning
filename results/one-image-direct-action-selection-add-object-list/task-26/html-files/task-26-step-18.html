VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to put two kettle in cabinet. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.

**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to countertop 1
(2): go to coffeemachine 1
(3): go to cabinet 1
(4): go to cabinet 2
(5): go to drawer 1
(6): go to sink 1
(7): go to sinkbasin 1
(8): go to garbagecan 1
(9): go to cabinet 4
(10): go to drawer 2
(11): go to fridge 1
(12): go to microwave 1
(13): go to dresser 1
(14): go to sidetable 1
(15): go to drawer 3
(16): go to drawer 4
(17): go to drawer 5
(18): go to drawer 6
(19): go to drawer 7
(20): go to drawer 8
(21): close cabinet 3
(22): examine pan 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: Based on the history information and the current observation, we are likely between steps 6 and 7 of the plan. We have previously located and placed one kettle in a cabinet (as per steps 1-4) and have been looking for a second kettle (step 5). The history suggests we have repeatedly been searching for kettles and cabinets and have been handling a frying pan which is not directly related to our current objective. The current observation includes a kettle, which aligns with step 5 of our plan, indicating that we have found the second kettle. Since the next step after finding a kettle is to pick it up (step 6), we need to take action to do so.

From the current observation, the following objects related to the task are visible:
- Kettle (the object we need to pick up next)
- Cabinet (where we will eventually need to place the kettle)

Therefore, we can directly proceed with picking up the kettle. However, there is no action to pick up the kettle listed in the "Admissible Actions." Given the available actions, the most appropriate next step would be to close the cabinet we have opened previously (cabinet 3), as it is the only action that relates to the objects in the current observation and the history information. After closing the cabinet, we may receive new actions that allow us to pick up the kettle.

The Most Appropriate Action: (21): close cabinet 3

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

**Context**
Analysis: Based on the history information and the current observation, we are likely between steps 6 and 7 of the plan. We have previously located and placed one kettle in a cabinet (as per steps 1-4) and have been looking for a second kettle (step 5).
