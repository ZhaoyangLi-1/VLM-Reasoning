VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to put two kettle in cabinet. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a kettle.
2. Pick up the kettle.
3. Find a cabinet.
4. Place the picked-up kettle in the cabinet.
5. Find another kettle.
6. Pick up the kettle.
7. Return to the previously located cabinet.
8. Place the second picked-up kettle in the cabinet with the first kettle.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>
Objects in The Image: ['kettle', 'kiwi', 'tomato', 'wine bottle', 'kitchen counter', 'frying pan']

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
State 0:
No history.
State 1:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Sink (without kettle)
3. Action: go to countertop 1
State 2:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Countertop, Lettuce, Apple, Bread, Plastic Cup
3. Action: go to coffeemachine 1
State 3:
1. Step Index in the Plan: Unknown (assumed next step after finding the statue)
2. Objects: Coffee Maker, Coffee Cup
3. Action: go to cabinet 1
State 4:
1. Step Index in the Plan: Likely after finding the kettle
2. Objects: Coffee Machine, Coffee Cup, Wooden Counter
3. Action: open cabinet 1
State 5:
1. Step Index in the Plan: Unknown
2. Objects: Coffee Maker, Coffee Cup, Wooden Counter, Cabinet 1 (opened)
3. Action: close cabinet 1
State 6:
1. Step Index in the Plan: Unclear (either verifying kettle placement or finding another kettle)
2. Objects: Coffee Maker, Cup, Table, Saucer, Sponge (none relevant to the current step)
3. Action: go to cabinet 2
State 7:
1. Step Index in the Plan: Unclear (potentially 3 or 7)
2. Objects: Kitchen counter, Sink, Plant, Cucumber, Knife, Bread, Cabinet doors
3. Action: open cabinet 2
State 8:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 7 or 8
2. Objects: Cabinet 2, Kettle inside Cabinet
3. Action: take pan 1 from cabinet 2
State 9:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 8
2. Objects: Frying Pan, Cabinet 2
3. Action: go to cabinet 3
State 10:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 5
2. Objects: Kettle, Countertop, Frying Pan, Cabinet
3. Action: put pan 1 in/on cabinet 3


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to countertop 1
(2): go to coffeemachine 1
(3): go to cabinet 1
(4): go to cabinet 2
(5): go to drawer 1
(6): go to sink 1
(7): go to sinkbasin 1
(8): go to garbagecan 1
(9): go to cabinet 4
(10): go to drawer 2
(11): go to fridge 1
(12): go to microwave 1
(13): go to dresser 1
(14): go to sidetable 1
(15): go to drawer 3
(16): go to drawer 4
(17): go to drawer 5
(18): go to drawer 6
(19): go to drawer 7
(20): go to drawer 8
(21): open cabinet 3
(22): close cabinet 3
(23): examine pan 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current observation shows a kettle on the countertop, which aligns with step 2 of the plan "Pick up the kettle." Since we have already located a kettle in a previous state (as mentioned in states 7 and 8), we are likely at step 6 in the plan, which is "Pick up the kettle." The objects related to the task in the current observation are a kettle, a kitchen counter, and a frying pan. Based on the history and the requirements for the current step, we can complete this step with the current observation because we have a kettle in front of us that needs to be picked up. The Most Appropriate Action: (23): examine pan 1. This is incorrect as the task is to pick up the kettle, not to examine the pan. However, the correct action for picking up the kettle is not provided in the list of admissible actions. Given the admissible actions, the closest action we can take that would continue with our current task is to go to the cabinet where we intend to place the kettle since the action to pick up the kettle is not available. The cabinet we opened previously in state 7 was cabinet 2, and in state 8, we see that a kettle was placed inside it. Since we are on step 6 of the plan, we should be looking to pick up the second kettle, but since this action is not available, we can prepare to complete step 7 by moving toward the cabinet where we will eventually place the kettle.

The Most Appropriate Action: (4): go to cabinet 2.

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1
