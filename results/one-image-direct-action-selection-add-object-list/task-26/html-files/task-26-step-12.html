VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to put two kettle in cabinet. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a kettle.
2. Pick up the kettle.
3. Find a cabinet.
4. Place the picked-up kettle in the cabinet.
5. Find another kettle.
6. Pick up the kettle.
7. Return to the previously located cabinet.
8. Place the second picked-up kettle in the cabinet with the first kettle.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

1. Step Index in the Plan: Unclear (potentially 3 or 7)
2. Objects: Kitchen counter, Sink, Plant, Cucumber, Knife, Bread, Cabinet doors
3. Action: open cabinet 2
State 8:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 7 or 8
2. Objects: Cabinet 2, Kettle inside Cabinet

State 9:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 8
2. Objects: Frying Pan, Cabinet 2

3. Action: put pan 1 in/on cabinet 3
State 11:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 6
2. Objects: Kettle, Kitchen Counter, Frying Pan
3. Action: go to cabinet 2
State 12:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 6
2. Objects: Kettle
3. Action: go to countertop 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to coffeemachine 1
(2): go to cabinet 1
(3): go to cabinet 2
(4): go to drawer 1
(5): go to sink 1
(6): go to sinkbasin 1
(7): go to cabinet 3
(8): go to garbagecan 1
(9): go to cabinet 4
(10): go to drawer 2
(11): go to fridge 1
(12): go to microwave 1
(13): go to dresser 1
(14): go to sidetable 1
(15): go to drawer 3
(16): go to drawer 4
(17): go to drawer 5
(18): go to drawer 6
(19): go to drawer 7
(20): go to drawer 8
(21): put pan 1 in/on countertop 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current step in the plan is unclear based on the history information provided, as the last known action was related to a frying pan rather than a kettle. The historical data suggests that the agent may have been in the process of either verifying the placement of the first kettle or finding a second kettle. However, there is no specific information about the successful completion of steps 4 or 8 (placing a kettle in the cabinet). The current observation shows a countertop with various objects, but no kettle is visible. The visible objects related to the task are a lettuce, an apple, a bread, and a frying pan. Since the current step is not explicitly known, and the kettle is not visible, it's reasonable to assume that the agent needs to find a kettle again, which suggests that we might be at step 5 or 6. Therefore, the most appropriate action would be to go to a location where a kettle might be found, which is not visible in the current scene. The admissible actions do not include anything about picking up or interacting with a kettle, so the best course of action is to move to another location to continue searching for a kettle.

The Most Appropriate Action: (3): go to cabinet 2

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

**Context**
Analysis: The current step in the plan is unclear based on the history information provided, as the last known action was related to a frying pan rather than a kettle. The historical data suggests that the agent may have been in the process of either verifying the placement of the first kettle or finding a second kettle.

Please summarize the context by following above examples when providing the summary, and ensure that only the summary is included, without any extra explanation.
