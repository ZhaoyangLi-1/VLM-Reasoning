VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to put two kettle in cabinet. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a kettle.
2. Pick up the kettle.
3. Find a cabinet.
4. Place the picked-up kettle in the cabinet.
5. Find another kettle.
6. Pick up the kettle.
7. Return to the previously located cabinet.
8. Place the second picked-up kettle in the cabinet with the first kettle.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

3. Action: open cabinet 2
State 8:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 7 or 8
2. Objects: Cabinet 2, Kettle inside Cabinet
3. Action: take pan 1 from cabinet 2
State 9:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 8
2. Objects: Frying Pan, Cabinet 2
3. Action: go to cabinet 3
State 10:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 5
2. Objects: Kettle, Countertop, Frying Pan, Cabinet
3. Action: put pan 1 in/on cabinet 3
State 11:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 6
2. Objects: Kettle, Kitchen Counter, Frying Pan
3. Action: go to cabinet 2


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to countertop 1
(2): go to coffeemachine 1
(3): go to cabinet 1
(4): go to cabinet 2
(5): go to drawer 1
(6): go to sink 1
(7): go to sinkbasin 1
(8): go to garbagecan 1
(9): go to cabinet 4
(10): go to drawer 2
(11): go to fridge 1
(12): go to microwave 1
(13): go to dresser 1
(14): go to sidetable 1
(15): go to drawer 3
(16): go to drawer 4
(17): go to drawer 5
(18): go to drawer 6
(19): go to drawer 7
(20): go to drawer 8
(21): open cabinet 3
(22): close cabinet 3

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: From the current observation, we can see a kettle, which indicates that we are on step 6 of the plan, which is to pick up the kettle. Since we are currently viewing from the perspective of holding a pan close to a countertop, and the historical data mentions putting the pan 1 in/on cabinet 3, it's likely that we have already placed the first kettle in the cabinet (steps 3 and 4) and have just placed the frying pan in a cabinet (step 10). We have now found the second kettle (step 5) and must pick it up (step 6). The visible objects in the image related to the task are the kettle. The next action should be to pick up the kettle, but since the admissible actions do not include a "pick up kettle" option, the most appropriate next action would be to go to the location of the kettle, which is the countertop, to simulate the action of picking it up. Therefore, we select the action to go to the countertop.

The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to countertop 1

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

**Context**
Analysis: From the current observation, we can see a kettle, which indicates that we are on step 6 of the plan, which is to pick up the kettle. Since we are currently viewing from the perspective of holding a pan close to a countertop, and the historical data mentions putting the pan 1 in/on cabinet 3, it's likely that we have already placed the first kettle in the cabinet (steps 3 and 4) and have just placed the frying pan in a cabinet (step 10). We have now found the second kettle (step 5) and must pick it up (step 6). The visible objects in the image related to the task are the kettle.
