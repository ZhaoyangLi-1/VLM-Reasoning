VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to put two kettle in cabinet. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.

6. Pick up the kettle.
7. Return to the previously located cabinet.
8. Place the second picked-up kettle in the cabinet with the first kettle.

**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to countertop 1
(2): go to coffeemachine 1
(3): go to cabinet 1
(4): go to cabinet 2
(5): go to drawer 1
(6): go to sink 1
(7): go to sinkbasin 1
(8): go to garbagecan 1
(9): go to drawer 2
(10): go to fridge 1
(11): go to microwave 1
(12): go to dresser 1
(13): go to sidetable 1
(14): go to drawer 3
(15): go to drawer 4
(16): go to drawer 5
(17): go to drawer 6
(18): go to drawer 7
(19): go to drawer 8
(20): open cabinet 3
(21): close cabinet 3
(22): examine pan 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current observation reveals that the agent is looking at a countertop with various objects, including a kettle which is required for the next step in the plan. The historical data indicates that the agent has already found and placed one kettle in a cabinet (Steps 1-4 of the plan) and has proceeded to find another kettle (Step 5). The agent has then moved around, possibly searching for a cabinet to place the second kettle. Since the kettle is visible in the current observation, we can assume that the agent is at Step 6 of the plan, which is to pick up the kettle. The objects related to the task that are visible in the current observation are a kettle, a kitchen counter, and a frying pan. The frying pan has been previously placed in a cabinet as suggested by the historical data, and it is not relevant for the current step. Given that the kettle is the object needed to progress in the plan, and it is in the agent's field of view, the next step is to pick it up. However, the admissible actions do not include an action to pick up the kettle. This means the agent needs to move to a location from where it can perform the pick-up action in subsequent turns. Since the kettle is already in the agent's immediate vicinity, no movement is required to get closer to it.

Therefore, the most appropriate action from the list of admissible actions would be to interact with the kettle, but since such an action is not present, we need to choose the next best option. The next logical step would be to prepare for placing the kettle into the appropriate cabinet, which would involve opening the cabinet if it is not already open. The historical data suggests that the agent might have already interacted with cabinet 3 recently, which could be the cabinet intended for placing the kettle. However, the admissible actions do not indicate whether the cabinet is open or closed.

Given the lack of a direct "pick up" action and the need to proceed with the plan to place the kettle in a cabinet, the most appropriate action from the available options seems to be to approach a cabinet with the intention of opening it to place the kettle inside. Since "open cabinet 3" is an available action, we could infer that the cabinet is currently closed and needs to be opened before the kettle can be placed inside.

The Most Appropriate Action: (20): open cabinet 3

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1
