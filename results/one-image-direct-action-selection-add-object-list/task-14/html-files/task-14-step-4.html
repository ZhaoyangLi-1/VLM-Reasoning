VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to cool some apple and put it in countertop. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find an apple.
2. Pick up the apple.
3. Find a fridge.
4. Cool the apple with the fridge.
5. Find a countertop.
6. Place the cooled apple on the countertop.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>
Objects in The Image: ['microwave', 'countertop', 'plant', 'vase']

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
State 0:
No history.
State 1:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Kitchen Sink, Faucet, Tap, Curtains, Window, Countertop, Drinking Glass
3. Action: go to fridge 1
State 2:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 4
2. Objects: Refrigerator, Toaster, Countertop
3. Action: open fridge 1
State 3:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 4
2. Objects: Refrigerator (open), Tomato
3. Action: close fridge 1
State 4:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 5
2. Objects: Refrigerator Door, Toaster, Countertop, Cabinet
3. Action: go to countertop 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to microwave 1
(2): go to cabinet 1
(3): go to diningtable 1
(4): go to drawer 1
(5): go to sink 1
(6): go to cabinet 2
(7): go to cabinet 3
(8): go to sinkbasin 1
(9): go to cabinet 4
(10): go to cabinet 5
(11): go to drawer 2
(12): go to countertop 2
(13): go to toaster 1
(14): go to cabinet 6
(15): go to stoveburner 1
(16): go to cabinet 7
(17): go to fridge 1
(18): go to stoveburner 2
(19): go to stoveburner 3
(20): go to stoveburner 4
(21): go to drawer 3
(22): go to cabinet 8
(23): go to cabinet 9
(24): go to cabinet 10
(25): go to coffeemachine 1
(26): go to cabinet 11
(27): go to garbagecan 1
(28): take soapbottle 1 from countertop 1
(29): take cup 1 from countertop 1
(30): take knife 1 from countertop 1
(31): take spatul1 from countertop 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: Based on the current observation and the history information provided, we have already found the refrigerator and attempted to cool the apple with it. However, the historical data indicates that after opening the fridge, the action taken was to close it without any mention of placing the apple inside. Therefore, it is unclear if the apple was cooled. The plan indicates that after cooling the apple, the next step is to find a countertop. Since the current observation shows a countertop, it appears we are ready to proceed with step 6 of the plan, which is to place the cooled apple on the countertop.

The objects visible in the current observation are a microwave and a countertop. However, no apple is visible in the image, which suggests that we cannot complete the final step of placing the cooled apple on the countertop because we do not have the apple in possession.

Considering the plan and the admissible actions, it seems there was a missed action of actually placing the apple in the fridge to cool it. Since the plan must be followed in order and the previous steps have not been confirmed as completed, we should not proceed to place the apple on the countertop. Unfortunately, there is no direct action available to cool the apple or confirm its cooling since there is no action to "take apple from fridge" or similar.

Given the constraints and the available admissible actions, the best course of action is to return to the fridge to ensure the apple has been cooled as per the plan. Since there is no direct action listed for cooling the apple or checking the fridge's contents, the closest relevant action we can take from the admissible actions is to go back to the fridge.

The Most Appropriate Action: (17): go to fridge 1

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1
