VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to heat some apple and put it in garbagecan. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current observation shows an image of what appears to be elevator doors with light reflections and vertical bars. There are no objects related to the task visible in the current observation. Based on the history, the last action taken was "go to fridge 1," which suggests that the agent may be in the vicinity of a fridge or a kitchen area, but the current image does not confirm this. Since the agent has already completed step 6 of the plan by placing an apple in the garbage can, the continuation of the plan seems to be in error, as the agent has been instructed to go to the fridge afterward. However, there is no direct task related to the fridge in the original plan. Therefore, the most appropriate action would be to return to the garbage can to reassess the situation or receive further instructions since the plan is to place a heated apple in the garbage can, which has already been done but may need confirmation.

The Most Appropriate Action: (21): go to garbagecan 1

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

There are no objects related to the task visible in the current observation.
