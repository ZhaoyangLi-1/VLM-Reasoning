VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to heat some apple and put it in garbagecan. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find an apple.
2. Pick up the apple.
3. Find a microwave.
4. Heat the apple with the microwave.
5. Find a garbage can.
6. Place the heated apple in the garbage can.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>
Objects in The Image: ['apple', 'kiwi', 'fork', 'sink', 'knife', 'cutting board']

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
No history.

**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to cabinet 1
(2): go to cabinet 2
(3): go to countertop 1
(4): go to cabinet 3
(5): go to cabinet 4
(6): go to cabinet 5
(7): go to sink 1
(8): go to cabinet 6
(9): go to drawer 1
(10): go to drawer 2
(11): go to sinkbasin 1
(12): go to cabinet 7
(13): go to cabinet 8
(14): go to coffeemachine 1
(15): go to microwave 1
(16): go to cabinet 9
(17): go to countertop 2
(18): go to cabinet 10
(19): go to drawer 3
(20): go to drawer 4
(21): go to garbagecan 1
(22): go to drawer 5
(23): go to cabinet 11
(24): go to cabinet 12
(25): go to cabinet 13
(26): go to cabinet 14
(27): go to stoveburner 1
(28): go to countertop 3
(29): go to stoveburner 2
(30): go to stoveburner 3
(31): go to stoveburner 4
(32): go to drawer 6
(33): go to cabinet 15
(34): go to cabinet 16
(35): go to cabinet 17
(36): go to cabinet 18
(37): go to toaster 1
(38): go to drawer 7
(39): go to countertop 4
(40): go to fridge 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The first step in our plan is to find an apple. According to the current observation, there is an apple on the cutting board next to the sink. As we have found an apple, we can proceed to the next step, which is to pick up the apple. The objects related to the task in the current observation are the apple, kiwi, fork, sink, knife, and cutting board. Since the apple is visible and accessible, we can complete the current step with the objects in the observation. Therefore, the most appropriate next action is to pick up the apple.

The Most Appropriate Action: (2): go to cabinet 2

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

**Context**
Analysis: The first step in our plan is to find an apple. According to the current observation, there is an apple on the cutting board next to the sink. As we have found an apple, we can proceed to the next step, which is to pick up the apple.
