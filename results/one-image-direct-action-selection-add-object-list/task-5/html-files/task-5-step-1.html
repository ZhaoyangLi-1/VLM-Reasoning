VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to put some book on armchair. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a book.
2. Pick up the book.
3. Find an armchair.
4. Place the picked-up book on the armchair.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>
Objects in The Image: ['wall', 'corner', 'sofa', 'floor', 'plant', 'pot', 'white table', 'pencil', 'milk jug']

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
State 0:
No history.
State 1:
2. Step Index in the Plan: 1
3. Objects: Painting, Sofa, Cardboard Box, Smartphone
4. Action: go to sidetable 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to armchair 1
(2): go to sofa 1
(3): go to coffeetable 1
(4): go to drawer 1
(5): go to dresser 1
(6): go to drawer 2
(7): go to drawer 3
(8): go to drawer 4
(9): go to sidetable 2
(10): go to sidetable 3
(11): take houseplant 1 from sidetable 1
(12): take wateringcan 1 from sidetable 1
(13): take pencil 1 from sidetable 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to find a book, which is step 1. Based upon the current observation and the historical data provided, there is no book visible in the current observation. The objects visible in the current observation are a wall, corner, sofa, floor, plant, pot, white table, pencil, and milk jug. None of these objects are books, so we cannot complete the current step with the current observation. Since books are often found on or in furniture pieces that store items, such as drawers, dressers, or side tables, the most appropriate action is to approach one of these items to search for a book. Among the admissible actions, going to a drawer or a side table seems the most likely to yield a book. Since there are multiple drawers listed, it would be efficient to start with the first one.

The Most Appropriate Action: (4): go to drawer 1

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

**Context**
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to find a book, which is step 1. Based upon the current observation and the historical data provided, there is no book visible in the current observation. The objects visible in the current observation are a wall, corner, sofa, floor, plant, pot, white table, pencil, and milk jug. None of these objects are books, so we cannot complete the current step with the current observation. Since books are often found on or in furniture pieces that store items, such as drawers, dressers, or side tables, the most appropriate action is to approach one of these items to search for a book. Among the admissible actions, going to a drawer or a side table seems the most likely to yield a book. Since there are multiple drawers listed, it would be efficient to start with the first one.

The Most Appropriate Action: (4): go to drawer 1

Please summarize the context by following above examples when providing the summary, and ensure that only the summary is included, without any extra explanation.
