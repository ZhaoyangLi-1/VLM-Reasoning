VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to put a cool tomato in microwave. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a tomato.
2. Pick up the tomato.
3. Find a fridge.
4. Cool the tomato with the fridge.
5. Find a microwave.
6. Place the cooled tomato in the microwave.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>
Objects in The Image: ['Window', 'Copper pots and pans', 'Salt shaker', 'Pepper grinder', 'Glass bottle with a stopper', 'Black clock', 'Stainless steel trash can']

(36): take peppershaker 1 from countertop 3
(37): take saltshaker 2 from countertop 3
(38): take stoveknob 1 from countertop 3
(39): take egg 1 from countertop 3

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: According to the history information, we have already found a tomato and are supposed to pick it up, which corresponds to step 2 in the plan. However, the current observation does not show a countertop with a tomato on it. Instead, we see a window, copper pots and pans, a salt shaker, a pepper grinder, a glass bottle with a stopper, a black clock, and a stainless steel trash can. None of these objects are relevant to the current step of picking up the tomato. Therefore, we need to navigate to a location where we can find and pick up the tomato. Since there are no actions listed that directly state "pick up tomato," we must move to a different location in the hopes of finding the tomato there. The action "go to countertop 4" seems to be the most appropriate as it implies a change of location within the kitchen where the tomato might be found.

The Most Appropriate Action: (26): go to countertop 4

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

**Context**
Analysis: According to the history information, we have already found a tomato and are supposed to pick it up, which corresponds to step 2 in the plan. However, the current observation does not show a countertop with a tomato on it.
