VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to look at plate under the floorlamp. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a plate.
2. Pick up the plate.
3. Locate a floorlamp.
4. Turn on the floorlamp.
5. Stand under the floorlamp with the plate in hand.
6. Look at the plate while standing under the floorlamp.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.

2. Objects: Door, Shelving Unit
3. Action: go to shelf 5
State 10:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Door, Staircase
3. Action: go to drawer 1
State 11:
1. Step Index in the Plan: Unknown
2. Objects: Floor Lamp, Bookshelf, Sofa, Coffee Table, End Table
3. Action: go to sidetable 2


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to armchair 1
(2): go to garbagecan 1
(3): go to tvstand 1
(4): go to shelf 1
(5): go to shelf 2
(6): go to sofa 1
(7): go to coffeetable 1
(8): go to sidetable 1
(9): go to shelf 3
(10): go to shelf 4
(11): take plate 3 from sidetable 2
(12): take vase 2 from sidetable 2

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to find a plate, which is step 1. The current observation shows a table with objects including papers, a blue funnel, and a blue book, but no plate is visible. Based on the historical data, the agent has visited various shelves, a coffee table, a side table, and other furniture, but there are no records indicating that the agent has found a plate yet. Since the plan requires finding a plate first, we must continue this action. In the admissible actions, there is an action to take a plate from a side table, which suggests that the agent has located a plate in a previous step that was not recorded in the history provided. The most appropriate action to advance towards the objective is to take the plate as it aligns with step 1 of the plan.

The Most Appropriate Action: (11): take plate 3 from sidetable 2

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

**Context**
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to find a plate, which is step 1. The current observation shows a table with objects including papers, a blue funnel, and a blue book, but no plate is visible. Based on the historical data, the agent has visited various shelves, a coffee table, a side table, and other furniture, but there are no records indicating that the agent has found a plate yet.

The most appropriate action to advance towards the objective is to take the plate as it aligns with step 1 of the plan.

The Most Appropriate Action: (11): take plate 3 from sidetable 2

Please summarize the context by following above examples when providing the summary, and ensure that only the summary is included, without any extra explanation.
