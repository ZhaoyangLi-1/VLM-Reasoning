Original Response:
Firstly, we need to identify all visible household objects relevant to the task "put two spraybottle in toilet." From the initial observation and the provided images, we can see that there is one spraybottle visible on the countertop.

The next step is to follow the task hint, which suggests that the agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. After that, the agent should look for another object of the desired type and repeat the process.

Given the task description and the initial observation, the most reasonable action from the choices provided would be to first go to the location where the visible spraybottle is located, pick it up, and then go to the toilet to place it.

In this case, the visible spraybottle is located on the countertop. So the first step towards completing the task would be to go to the countertop to pick up the spraybottle.

The answer is: (7): go to countertop 1
