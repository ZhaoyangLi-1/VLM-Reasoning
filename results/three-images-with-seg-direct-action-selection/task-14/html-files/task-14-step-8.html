**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided image to identify all visible household objects, focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a cool apple in countertop."
2. Use the analysis of the image and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a cool apple in countertop"?
4. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in the image, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

Original Response:
First, we need to find an apple, which is a type of object that might be stored in a cabinet or a drawer in a kitchen setting. Looking at the images provided, we can see there is an apple on countertop 2 in Image 3, labeled as "apple 1." 

Next, according to the task hint, the agent must cool the apple with the fridge. We can see the fridge in all images, labeled as "fridge 1."

Finally, the agent needs to place the cooled apple on a countertop. Since the instruction doesn't specify which countertop to use, we can assume any countertop will suffice. However, since the apple is already on countertop 2, it would be most reasonable to cool the apple and place it back on the same countertop.

The answer is: (13): go to countertop 2.
