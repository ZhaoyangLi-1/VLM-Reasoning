VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
Image2:
<image>
Image3:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided image to identify all visible household objects, focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a cool apple in countertop."
2. Use the analysis of the image and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a cool apple in countertop"?
4. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in the image, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

Original Response:
First, we need to find an apple, which is visible in the images. The apple is labeled as "apple 1" on "countertop 2" in all three images.

Next, according to the task description, the agent must "put a cool apple in countertop." Since the apple is already on the countertop, we can skip picking it up and going to a fridge to cool it down. However, we must simulate the action of cooling the apple with the fridge as per the hint provided.

Therefore, the most reasonable action from the choices given would be to go to the fridge to cool the apple. After that, we would need to place the cool apple back on the countertop, but since the apple is already on "countertop 2," we do not need to move it again.

The answer is: (17): go to fridge 1.
