Original Response:
Firstly, the task is to put a cool apple on the countertop. Since the agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, we can assume that the apple is already cool or can be cooled by simply being near the fridge.

From the initial observation, "fridge (1)" is mentioned, so we know there is a fridge in the room. Looking at Image 2, we can see the "fridge 1" is labeled, so we know its location.

The next step would be to find an apple, but there is no apple visible in either of the provided images. Based on the initial observation, there are multiple cabinets and drawers where an apple could possibly be found. Since "cabinet 1" is the first one mentioned, it would be a reasonable place to start searching.

Therefore, the most reasonable action from the choices provided for the task description "put a cool apple in countertop" would be to first find the apple. Since the apple is not visible in the provided images, the agent must search the cabinets.

The answer is: (3): go to cabinet 1.
