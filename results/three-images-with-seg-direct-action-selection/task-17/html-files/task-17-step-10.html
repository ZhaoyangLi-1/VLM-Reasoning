VLM Prompt:

Image2:
<image>
Image3:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided image to identify all visible household objects, focusing on those relevant to the task description "cool some pan and put it in stoveburner."
2. Use the analysis of the image and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "cool some pan and put it in stoveburner"?
4. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in the image, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see cabinet (1-14), countertop (1-2), microwave (1), drawer (1-5), sink (1), sinkbasin (1), coffeemachine (1), stoveburner (1-4), toaster (1), fridge (1), diningtable (1), garbagecan (1), safe (1)

**Answer Choices**
(1): go to cabinet 2
(2): go to cabinet 3
(3): go to countertop 1
(4): go to cabinet 4
(5): go to cabinet 5
(6): go to microwave 1
(7): go to cabinet 6
(8): go to drawer 1
(9): go to drawer 2
(10): go to drawer 3
(11): go to cabinet 7
(12): go to cabinet 8
(13): go to sink 1
(14): go to sinkbasin 1
(15): go to coffeemachine 1
(16): go to cabinet 9
(17): go to cabinet 10
(18): go to drawer 4
(19): go to cabinet 11
(20): go to stoveburner 1
(21): go to stoveburner 2
(22): go to stoveburner 3
(23): go to stoveburner 4
(24): go to cabinet 12
(25): go to toaster 1
(26): go to drawer 5
(27): go to countertop 2
(28): go to cabinet 13
(29): go to cabinet 14
(30): go to diningtable 1
(31): go to garbagecan 1
(32): go to safe 1
(33): open cabinet 1
(34): close cabinet 1
(35): examine cabinet 1

**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.

Original Response:
First, we need to find an object of the desired type, which in this case is a pan. The provided images do not show any pans, so we will rely on the Initial Observation to find the object. Cabinets are common places to store pans, so it is reasonable to search there first.

Next, we need to cool the pan with the fridge. However, since there is no interaction needed with the fridge other than the action "cool the object with the fridge," we do not need to consider the location of the fridge at this moment.

Finally, we need to put the cooled pan in a stoveburner. According to the Initial Observation, there are four stoveburners available.

Based on these steps, the most reasonable action from the choices provided would be to first go to a cabinet where a pan might be stored, then go to a stoveburner to place the pan. Since no specific cabinet number is given for where a pan might be, we can choose one that is listed in both the Initial Observation and the answer choices.

The answer is: (4): go to cabinet 4. This action aligns with the first step of finding a pan. Once the pan is found, we would then proceed to a stoveburner, but the specific action for that is not listed in the choices.
