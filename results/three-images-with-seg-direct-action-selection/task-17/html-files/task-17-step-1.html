VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
Image2:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided image to identify all visible household objects, focusing on those relevant to the task description "cool some pan and put it in stoveburner."
2. Use the analysis of the image and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "cool some pan and put it in stoveburner"?
4. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in the image, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

Original Response:
The task is to "cool some pan and put it in stoveburner." The hint suggests the agent must find a pan, cool it with the fridge, then place it on the stove burner.

From the initial observation, we know there is a fridge, stove burners, and multiple cabinets in the room.

Since no pan is visible in the provided images and the instructions do not require the agent to open cabinets to find objects, we should search for the pan based on the initial observation.

The most reasonable first action would be to go to a cabinet where pans are typically stored. It's common to store pans in lower cabinets near the stove for easy access when cooking, but since we do not have information on the specific location of the pan, we need to select a cabinet to search.

The answer is: (1): go to cabinet 2.
