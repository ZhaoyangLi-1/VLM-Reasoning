**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided image to identify all visible household objects, focusing on those relevant to the task description "cool some pan and put it in stoveburner."
2. Use the analysis of the image and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there.

4. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in the image, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

Original Response:
Firstly, the task is to "cool some pan and put it in stoveburner." For this task, we would need a pan and a fridge to cool it, and then we need to place it on a stoveburner.

From the initial observation, we know that there is a fridge in the room. However, there is no mention of a pan in the initial observation or visible in the images provided. Since we cannot see the entire room and all the cabinets in the images, we must search every place to find the pan based on the initial observation.

Based on this information, the most reasonable action from the choices would be to search the cabinets as they are common storage places for pans in a household. Since we do not know which cabinet the pan is in, we should start with the first cabinet and proceed sequentially.

The answer is: (1): go to cabinet 1
