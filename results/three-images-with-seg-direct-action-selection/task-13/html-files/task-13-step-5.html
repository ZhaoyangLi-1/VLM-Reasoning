VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
Image2:
<image>
Image3:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided image to identify all visible household objects, focusing on those relevant to the task description "clean some tomato and put it in garbagecan."
2. Use the analysis of the image and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a sink or a basin, clean the object with a sink or basin, and then find the correct location to place it and put it down there. The agent does not need to use soap bottle or faucet to clean the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "clean the object with the sink or sink basin"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "clean some tomato and put it in garbagecan"?
4. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in the image, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see countertop (1-2), cabinet (1-11), garbagecan (1), toaster (1), sinkbasin (1), fridge (1), sink (1), microwave (1), drawer (1-3), stoveburner (1-4), coffeemachine (1), diningtable (1)

**Answer Choices**
(1): go to countertop 1
(2): go to cabinet 1
(3): go to cabinet 2
(4): go to cabinet 3
(5): go to garbagecan 1
(6): go to cabinet 4
(7): go to toaster 1
(8): go to fridge 1
(9): go to sink 1
(10): go to cabinet 5
(11): go to microwave 1
(12): go to countertop 2
(13): go to cabinet 6
(14): go to cabinet 7
(15): go to drawer 1
(16): go to stoveburner 1
(17): go to stoveburner 2
(18): go to cabinet 8
(19): go to drawer 2
(20): go to stoveburner 3
(21): go to stoveburner 4
(22): go to coffeemachine 1
(23): go to cabinet 9
(24): go to cabinet 10
(25): go to cabinet 11
(26): go to diningtable 1
(27): go to drawer 3
(28): put tomato 1 in/on sinkbasin 1
(29): clean tomato 1 with sinkbasin 1
(30): clean tomato 1 with sink 1
(31): examine tomato 1
(32): examine sinkbasin 1

**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.
----------------------------------------

----------------------------------------

Original Response:
First, we need to find a tomato to clean. In Image1 and Image2, we can see tomato 1 inside the fridge. This is the tomato we need to clean. Therefore, we can ignore answer choices (1) to (7) and (9) to (27) since they don't involve interacting with the tomato.

Next, according to the task description, we need to clean the tomato. In Image3, we can see that the sink is right next to the tomato, which is on the countertop. The agent does not need to use soap or faucet, so we can ignore choices (31) and (32) which involve examining.

Among the remaining choices, (28) is incorrect because it involves putting the tomato in/on the sinkbasin, and (30) is the correct action as it directly involves cleaning the tomato with the sink, which is the next reasonable action after picking up the tomato.

The answer is: (30): clean tomato 1 with sink 1.
