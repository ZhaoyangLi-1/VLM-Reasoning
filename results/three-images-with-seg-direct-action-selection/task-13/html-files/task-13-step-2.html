Original Response:
First, analyze the provided image to identify all visible household objects. The visible objects in Image 1 are countertop 1, sink 1, sinkbasin 1, and garbagecan 1. The task description is to "clean some tomato and put it in garbagecan." 

Based on the task hint, the agent must find a tomato, pick it up, go to a sink or a basin, clean the tomato, and then put it in the garbagecan. The agent does not need to use soap bottle or faucet, just needs to do the action of cleaning the object with the sink or sink basin. 

From the Initial Observation, we know there is a fridge in the room. It is common to store tomatoes in the fridge. Therefore, the first step should be to find the tomato. 

Since we cannot see a tomato in the visible area, we need to search for it. The most reasonable place to find a tomato would be in the fridge.

The answer is: (28): open fridge 1.
