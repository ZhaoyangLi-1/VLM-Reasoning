VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
Image2:
<image>
Image3:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided image to identify all visible household objects, focusing on those relevant to the task description "clean some soapbar and put it in bathtubbasin."
2. Use the analysis of the image and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a sink or a basin, clean the object with a sink or basin, and then find the correct location to place it and put it down there. The agent does not need to use soap bottle or faucet to clean the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "clean the object with the sink or sink basin"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "clean some soapbar and put it in bathtubbasin"?
4. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in the image, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see bathtub (1), bathtubbasin (1), toilet (1), cabinet (1-2), countertop (1), sink (1), sinkbasin (1), garbagecan (1)

**Answer Choices**
(1): go to bathtub 1
(2): go to bathtubbasin 1
(3): go to toilet 1
(4): go to countertop 1
(5): go to sink 1
(6): go to sinkbasin 1
(7): go to garbagecan 1
(8): open cabinet 2
(9): close cabinet 2
(10): put cloth 1 in/on cabinet 2
(11): examine cloth 1
(12): examine cabinet 2

**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.

Original Response:
First, we need to find a soapbar, which is not visible in any of the provided images. We need to search every place based on the Initial Observation to find the object. Once we find the soapbar, we need to clean it. According to the task hint, we don't need to use soap bottle or faucet, so we can skip that part. The agent just needs to clean the object with the sink or sink basin.

Based on the Initial Observation, the most reasonable places to search for the soapbar would be the cabinets. Once we have the soapbar, we can clean it at the sink or sink basin and then put it in the bathtub basin.

The answer is: (8): open cabinet 2. This action will allow us to search for the soapbar, which is the first step in completing the task. If the soapbar is found inside cabinet 2, the next step would be to go to the sink or sink basin to clean it, and then go to the bathtub basin to place it.
