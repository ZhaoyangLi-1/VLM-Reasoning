VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
Image2:
<image>
Image3:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided image to identify all visible household objects, focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a clean tomato in countertop."
2. Use the analysis of the image and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a sink or a basin, clean the object with a sink or basin, and then find the correct location to place it and put it down there. The agent does not need to use soap bottle or faucet to clean the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "clean the object with the sink or sink basin"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a clean tomato in countertop"?
4. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in the image, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see cabinet (1-6), microwave (1), countertop (1-2), coffeemachine (1), toaster (1), sink (1), sinkbasin (1), fridge (1)

**Answer Choices**
(1): go to cabinet 1
(2): go to cabinet 2
(3): go to cabinet 3
(4): go to microwave 1
(5): go to cabinet 4
(6): go to cabinet 5
(7): go to cabinet 6
(8): go to countertop 1
(9): go to coffeemachine 1
(10): go to toaster 1
(11): go to countertop 2
(12): go to sink 1
(13): go to sinkbasin 1
(14): open fridge 1
(15): close fridge 1
(16): take apple 1 from fridge 1
(17): take potato 1 from fridge 1

**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.

Original Response:
Firstly, we need to find a tomato. Based on the Initial Observation, we know there is a fridge in the room that could possibly contain a tomato. Therefore, the first reasonable action would be to check inside the fridge.

Image 2 and Image 3 both show the inside of the fridge, revealing an apple and a potato, but no tomato. Since there is no tomato inside the fridge, we must search other areas mentioned in the Initial Observation.

However, since the task specifically mentions "countertop," it is reasonable to assume that the tomato may be on the countertop. Unfortunately, the countertop is not visible in the provided images, so we cannot verify if there is a tomato there.

Since no other locations have been depicted or hinted at containing a tomato, and based on the Initial Observation, the next reasonable step would be to search the areas we have not yet inspected.

The answer is: (1): go to cabinet 1.
