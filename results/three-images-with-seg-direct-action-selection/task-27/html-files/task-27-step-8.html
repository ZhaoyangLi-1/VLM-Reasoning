Original Response:
The task is to find two soap bottles and put them in the garbage can. Starting with Image 1, we can see that there is a soap bottle (soapbottle 1) on the countertop next to the sink. Therefore, the first step is to go to the soap bottle and pick it up.

Looking at the answer choices, there is no option to pick up the soap bottle. However, there is an option to go to the location where the soap bottle is. The most logical action to take first would be to go to the location of the soap bottle to pick it up.

The answer is: (1): go to countertop 1
