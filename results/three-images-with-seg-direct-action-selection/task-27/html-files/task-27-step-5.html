Original Response:
The task is to find two soapbottles and put them in the garbagecan. From the initial observations, we see that there is a garbagecan and two sinkbasins mentioned. The images provided show two soapbottles, one on each sinkbasin. 

To accomplish the task, the agent must first go to where the soapbottles are located, pick up each one, and then go to the garbagecan to dispose of them.

Starting with the first soapbottle:
- Soapbottle 1 is on the countertop near sinkbasin 1 (visible in Image1 and Image2).
- The agent should go to sinkbasin 1 to be close to the soapbottle.
- The next step would be to take soapbottle 1 from the countertop.

Then, for the second soapbottle:
- Soapbottle 2 is on the countertop near sinkbasin 2 (visible in Image1).
- The agent should go to sinkbasin 2 to be close to the second soapbottle after disposing of the first one in the garbagecan.

Therefore, the most reasonable first action for the agent to take according to the task description "find two soapbottle and put them in garbagecan" is to go to sinkbasin 1 where soapbottle 1 is located.

The answer is: (1): go to sinkbasin 1
