Original Response:
The task is to find two tomatoes and put them on the countertop. 

Looking at the initial observation, we know there are various cabinets, drawers, and other appliances in the room.

Analyzing Image 1, Image 2, and Image 3, we can see a tomato labeled "tomato 1" sitting on the countertop 2. There is no other tomato visible in the images provided. Since we already have one tomato on the countertop, the next reasonable action would be to search for the second tomato.

None of the answer choices directly suggest searching for another tomato. However, since we need to find another tomato and none is visible on the countertop, we should start searching the cabinets as they are typical storage places for such items. The answer choice "go to cabinet 3" seems to be a reasonable next step, as it is the next sequential number after the cabinets visible in the images (cabinet 2 and cabinet 12).

The answer is: (3): go to cabinet 3. If another tomato is not found there, continue searching other cabinets and drawers based on the initial observation until the second tomato is found. Then, return to countertop 2 to place it with the first tomato.
