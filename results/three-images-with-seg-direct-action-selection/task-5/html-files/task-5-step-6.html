Original Response:
The task is to "put some book on armchair." From the images provided, we can see an armchair labeled as "armchair 1" but no books are visible in any of the images. Therefore, we need to search for a book based on the initial observation, which suggests looking in drawers or dressers where such items might typically be stored.

The most reasonable action from the choices would be to first look for the book. Since drawers are commonly used to store small items like books, it's logical to start by examining the drawers. The action of examining drawer 1 seems to be the most relevant to finding a book.

The answer is: (19): examine drawer 1.
