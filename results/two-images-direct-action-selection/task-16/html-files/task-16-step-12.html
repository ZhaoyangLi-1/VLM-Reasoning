VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
Image2:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a cool pan in sinkbasin."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a cool pan in sinkbasin"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.
----------------------------------------

----------------------------------------

Original Response:
Image Analysis:
- In both images, there is a visible pot that seems to be the object relevant to the task description "put a cool pan in sinkbasin."
- In Image 1, the pot is on the countertop next to the stoveburner and seems not to be in use.
- In Image 2, the pot is still on the countertop, and there is no visible change regarding its state (e.g., it's not on hand, not on the stove, not opened or closed).

Task Hint Analysis:
- The agent must find the pot, which is already visible in the images.
- The agent must cool the pot with the fridge but does not need to interact with buttons or open the fridge.
- The agent must then find the sinkbasin and put the pot in it.

Based on the initial observation, the agent is in the middle of the room, and the fridge and sinkbasin are mentioned as present. The images show the pot on the countertop, which seems to be "countertop 2" as it is next to the stoveburners.

Most Reasonable Action:
- The agent needs to cool the pot with the fridge and then put it in the sinkbasin.
- The pot does not need to be cleaned as the task only mentions cooling it and placing it in the sinkbasin.
- Among the answer choices, the agent should first go to the fridge to cool the pot and then proceed to put it in the sinkbasin.

The answer is: (21): go to fridge 1
