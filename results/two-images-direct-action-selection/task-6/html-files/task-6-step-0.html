VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put some cd on safe."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, find the correct location to place it, and put it down there." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put some cd on safe"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see bed (1-2), dresser (1), sidetable (1-2), drawer (1-11), desk (1), garbagecan (1), safe (1)

**Answer Choices**
(1): go to bed 1
(2): go to dresser 1
(3): go to bed 2
(4): go to sidetable 1
(5): go to drawer 1
(6): go to drawer 2
(7): go to sidetable 2
(8): go to drawer 3
(9): go to drawer 4
(10): go to desk 1
(11): go to garbagecan 1
(12): go to drawer 5
(13): go to drawer 6
(14): go to drawer 7
(15): go to drawer 8
(16): go to drawer 9
(17): go to drawer 10
(18): go to drawer 11
(19): go to safe 1


**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.

Original Response:
Image Analysis:
- The image shows a bedside table with a phone and a credit card on it. There are no CDs visible on the table. The wall is plain, and there is a part of a bed visible on the right side.

Task Analysis:
- The task is to "put some cd on safe." For this task, the agent needs to find a CD first.

Initial Observation:
- According to the initial observation, there are several objects in the room: beds, a dresser, side tables, drawers, a desk, a garbage can, and a safe.

Most Reasonable Action:
- Since the visible objects in the image do not include a CD, the agent needs to search other locations to find one. Given that CDs are most likely to be stored in drawers or on a desk, the agent should check these locations first.
- The safe is mentioned as a separate object, so it is reasonable to assume that the agent will need to go to the safe after finding the CD.

The answer is: (5): go to drawer 1
