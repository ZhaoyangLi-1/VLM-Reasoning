**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "cool some tomato and put it in microwave."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "cool some tomato and put it in microwave"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

Original Response:
From the provided images, we can see a tomato on the countertop and a microwave that is open. According to the task description "cool some tomato and put it in microwave," we need to cool the tomato first. The task hint tells us that we do not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, so we can skip the action of opening the fridge. However, we need to go to the fridge to perform the action "cool the object with the fridge." Since the images show the tomato on the countertop and not yet cooled, the next reasonable action would be to cool the tomato.

The answer is: (4): go to fridge 1
