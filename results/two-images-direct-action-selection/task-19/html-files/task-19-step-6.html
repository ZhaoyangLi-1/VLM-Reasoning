VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
Image2:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "cool some tomato and put it in microwave."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "cool some tomato and put it in microwave"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.
----------------------------------------

Original Response:
Image1 shows a closed cabinet, and there are no objects that can be identified as a tomato, so we can disregard this image for the task at hand.

Image2 shows an open fridge with several items inside, including a pan, a mug, a bowl, and what appears to be an apple on the middle shelf. There is also another apple on the bottom shelf. However, there is no visible tomato.

Since the task description is "cool some tomato and put it in microwave," we need to find a tomato first. The initial observation doesn't mention where the tomatoes are, so we have to search in likely places where a tomato could be stored, such as the fridge or on the countertop.

Based on the images provided and the initial observation, the most reasonable action to find a tomato would be to look in the fridge first since that's a common place to store fresh produce. However, the images show no tomato in the fridge, so we would need to search elsewhere.

Since the images do not show a countertop and the initial observation lists multiple countertops, it would be reasonable to check the countertops next.

The answer is: (22): go to countertop 2
