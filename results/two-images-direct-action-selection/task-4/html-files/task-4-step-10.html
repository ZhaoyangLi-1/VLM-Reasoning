VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
Image2:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "look at statue under the floorlamp."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, locate and turn on a light source with the desired object in-hand." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "look at statue under the floorlamp"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see armchair (1), coffeetable (1-2), sidetable (1), garbagecan (1), drawer (1), sofa (1), diningtable (1)

**Answer Choices**
(1): go to armchair 1
(2): go to sidetable 1
(3): go to garbagecan 1
(4): go to drawer 1
(5): go to sofa 1
(6): go to coffeetable 2
(7): go to diningtable 1
(8): put statue 1 in/on coffeetable 1
(9): examine coffeetable 1


**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.

Original Response:
1. Analyzing the provided images, we can see a statue being held by a human-like figure. There are no other visible household objects in the images that are relevant to the task description of "look at statue under the floorlamp." There is no difference between the two images provided, and the statue is not under a floorlamp in either image.

2. Based on the task hint, the agent must find the statue (which is already in hand in the images), locate a light source, and turn it on with the statue in hand to complete the task of looking at the statue under the floorlamp.

3. Since the images do not show a floorlamp, the agent must search the room to find it. The answer choices provided do not include an action directly related to finding or interacting with a floorlamp. However, since we need to find a light source, we can infer that a sidetable or a coffeetable might have a lamp on it.

The answer is: (2): go to sidetable 1
