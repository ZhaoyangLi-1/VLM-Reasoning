VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
Image2:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a creditcard in coffeetable."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, find the correct location to place it, and put it down there." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a creditcard in coffeetable"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see armchair (1-2), dresser (1), garbagecan (1), cabinet (1-4), drawer (1-4), coffeetable (1), sidetable (1), sofa (1)

**Answer Choices**
(1): go to armchair 1
(2): go to armchair 2
(3): go to dresser 1
(4): go to garbagecan 1
(5): go to cabinet 1
(6): go to drawer 2
(7): go to cabinet 2
(8): go to drawer 3
(9): go to cabinet 3
(10): go to drawer 4
(11): go to cabinet 4
(12): go to coffeetable 1
(13): go to sidetable 1
(14): go to sofa 1
(15): open drawer 1
(16): close drawer 1
(17): examine drawer 1


**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.

Original Response:
Image 1 shows a sofa with two remote controls on it and no credit card in sight. Image 2 shows a golden statue and a credit card on the floor near the coffeetable. Based on the task description, "put a creditcard in coffeetable," we can see the credit card is already near the coffeetable, but it's not on it.

Given the task hint, the agent must find the credit card and put it on the coffeetable. Since the credit card is visible in Image 2 on the floor near the coffeetable, the most reasonable action from the choices provided would be to pick up the credit card and place it on the coffeetable.

The answer is: (12): go to coffeetable 1
