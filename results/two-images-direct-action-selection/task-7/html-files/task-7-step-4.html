VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
Image2:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a creditcard in coffeetable."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, find the correct location to place it, and put it down there." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a creditcard in coffeetable"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see armchair (1-2), dresser (1), garbagecan (1), cabinet (1-4), drawer (1-4), coffeetable (1), sidetable (1), sofa (1)

**Answer Choices**
(1): go to armchair 1
(2): go to armchair 2
(3): go to dresser 1
(4): go to garbagecan 1
(5): go to drawer 1
(6): go to drawer 2
(7): go to cabinet 2
(8): go to drawer 3
(9): go to cabinet 3
(10): go to drawer 4
(11): go to cabinet 4
(12): go to sidetable 1
(13): go to sofa 1
(14): open cabinet 1
(15): close cabinet 1
(16): examine cabinet 1

Original Response:
1. In Image1, we see a coffeetable with an open cardboard box and a TV remote on it. In Image2, we see a golden statue-like object on a surface that appears to be another table, next to which we find a credit card and some other scattered objects. 

2. Based on the task description "put a creditcard in coffeetable" and the task hint, we should look for a credit card and place it on the coffeetable. In Image2, there is a visible credit card next to the golden statue on a surface that may be a sidetable, indicating that the credit card is not yet on the coffeetable as the task requires.

3. The answer is: (12): go to sidetable 1, because that is where we can see the credit card in Image2, which we need to pick up and put on the coffeetable to complete the task.
