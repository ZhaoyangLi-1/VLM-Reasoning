VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a clean tomato in countertop."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a sink or a basin, clean the object with a sink or basin, and then find the correct location to place it and put it down there. The agent does not need to use soap bottle or faucet to clean the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "clean the object with the sink or sink basin"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a clean tomato in countertop"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see cabinet (1-6), microwave (1), countertop (1-2), coffeemachine (1), toaster (1), sink (1), sinkbasin (1), fridge (1)

**Answer Choices**
(1): go to cabinet 1
(2): go to cabinet 2
(3): go to cabinet 3
(4): go to microwave 1
(5): go to cabinet 4
(6): go to cabinet 5
(7): go to cabinet 6
(8): go to countertop 1
(9): go to coffeemachine 1
(10): go to toaster 1
(11): go to countertop 2
(12): go to sink 1
(13): go to sinkbasin 1
(14): go to fridge 1


**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.

Original Response:
First, we analyze the image provided:

Image 1:
- Sink 1 is visible, appears to be clean, and the faucet is closed.
- Sinkbasin 1 is not visible in the image, but it is mentioned in the initial observation.
- No other household objects relevant to the task are visible in the image.

Now, considering the task description "put a clean tomato in countertop" and the hint provided, the agent must first find a tomato, clean it using the sink or sink basin, and then place it on the countertop. As per the initial observation, the tomato could be inside the fridge or a cabinet.

Since the image does not show any tomatoes, we need to search for the tomato based on the initial observation. The most likely places to find a tomato would be inside the fridge or a cabinet where food might be stored.

The answer is: (14): go to fridge 1
