VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
Image2:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a clean tomato in countertop."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a sink or a basin, clean the object with a sink or basin, and then find the correct location to place it and put it down there. The agent does not need to use soap bottle or faucet to clean the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "clean the object with the sink or sink basin"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a clean tomato in countertop"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see cabinet (1-6), microwave (1), countertop (1-2), coffeemachine (1), toaster (1), sink (1), sinkbasin (1), fridge (1)

**Answer Choices**
(1): go to cabinet 2
(2): go to cabinet 3
(3): go to microwave 1
(4): go to cabinet 4
(5): go to cabinet 5
(6): go to cabinet 6
(7): go to countertop 1
(8): go to coffeemachine 1
(9): go to toaster 1
(10): go to countertop 2
(11): go to sink 1
(12): go to sinkbasin 1
(13): open cabinet 1
(14): close cabinet 1
(15): examine cabinet 1


**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.

Original Response:
From Image 1, we can see a tomato on the countertop shelf, which is relevant to our task. The tomato is the object we need to clean and put on the countertop.

From Image 2, we observe the front of a cabinet, which is closed, and there doesn't seem to be a tomato or any object of interest in hand or opened.

Since the task description is "put a clean tomato in countertop" and we already have located a tomato on the countertop shelf in Image 1, we do not need to search through the cabinets (1-6) or use the microwave, coffeemachine, or toaster.

The most reasonable action to perform the task would be to:
- Pick up the tomato from the countertop shelf where it is located.
- Go to the sink or sink basin to clean the tomato, as per the task hint.
- Put the clean tomato back on the countertop, specifically countertop 1 or 2.

Since we already have the tomato located on the countertop shelf, we can skip straight to cleaning it. Therefore, the next step is to go to the sink or sink basin to clean the tomato before placing it on the countertop.

The answer is: (11): go to sink 1
