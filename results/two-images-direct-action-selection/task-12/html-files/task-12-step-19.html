VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
Image2:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a clean tomato in countertop."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a sink or a basin, clean the object with a sink or basin, and then find the correct location to place it and put it down there. The agent does not need to use soap bottle or faucet to clean the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "clean the object with the sink or sink basin"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a clean tomato in countertop"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see cabinet (1-6), microwave (1), countertop (1-2), coffeemachine (1), toaster (1), sink (1), sinkbasin (1), fridge (1)

**Answer Choices**
(1): go to cabinet 1
(2): go to cabinet 2
(3): go to cabinet 3
(4): go to microwave 1
(5): go to cabinet 4
(6): go to cabinet 5
(7): go to cabinet 6
(8): go to countertop 1
(9): go to coffeemachine 1
(10): go to toaster 1
(11): go to countertop 2
(12): go to sinkbasin 1
(13): open fridge 1
(14): close fridge 1
(15): take apple 1 from fridge 1
(16): take potato 1 from fridge 1
(17): examine fridge 1


**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.

Original Response:
Image Analysis:
Image1 shows a sink with a visible faucet, and no objects in hand or around the sink area that are relevant to the task. Image2 shows a shelf with an apple and a tomato, and no objects in hand. The tomato is the object relevant to the task since we need to "put a clean tomato in countertop."

Task Analysis:
Based on the task description and hint, the agent must find a tomato, clean it in the sink or sink basin, and then place it on the countertop. Since the tomato is already visible in Image2 on the shelf, the agent does not need to search for it in cabinets or the fridge.

Answer:
Given the information and the task, the most reasonable action from the choices provided is to go to the shelf where the tomato is, pick it up, clean it in the sink, and then place it on the countertop. However, the options do not include picking up the tomato from the shelf, cleaning it, or placing it on the countertop. The closest action related to the task would be to go to the sink basin where the agent can clean the tomato. Therefore, the answer is: (12): go to sinkbasin 1.
