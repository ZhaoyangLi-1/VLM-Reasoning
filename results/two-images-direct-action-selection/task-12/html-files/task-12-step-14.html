VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
Image2:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a clean tomato in countertop."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a sink or a basin, clean the object with a sink or basin, and then find the correct location to place it and put it down there. The agent does not need to use soap bottle or faucet to clean the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "clean the object with the sink or sink basin"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a clean tomato in countertop"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see cabinet (1-6), microwave (1), countertop (1-2), coffeemachine (1), toaster (1), sink (1), sinkbasin (1), fridge (1)

**Answer Choices**
(1): go to cabinet 1
(2): go to cabinet 2
(3): go to cabinet 3
(4): go to microwave 1
(5): go to cabinet 4
(6): go to cabinet 5
(7): go to cabinet 6
(8): go to countertop 1
(9): go to coffeemachine 1
(10): go to toaster 1
(11): go to countertop 2
(12): go to sink 1
(13): go to sinkbasin 1
(14): open fridge 1
(15): close fridge 1
(16): take apple 1 from fridge 1
(17): take potato 1 from fridge 1
(18): examine fridge 1


**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.

Original Response:
First, we analyze the provided images:

Image1: It shows a closed cabinet with no objects visible on or inside the cabinet. Therefore, it is not relevant for the task of putting a clean tomato on the countertop.

Image2: It shows a dark image of what appears to be an open cabinet or shelving unit with a visible apple and potato on one of the shelves. This is relevant as we need to find a tomato, which is not visible in this image.

Based on the task hint, the agent must find a tomato, clean it, and then place it on the countertop. Since we cannot see a tomato in the provided images, we must search every place based on the initial observation to find it.

Since the fridge is a common place to store tomatoes, we should check there first.

The answer is: (14): open fridge 1.
