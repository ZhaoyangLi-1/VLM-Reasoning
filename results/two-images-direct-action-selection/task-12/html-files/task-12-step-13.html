VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
Image2:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a clean tomato in countertop."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a sink or a basin, clean the object with a sink or basin, and then find the correct location to place it and put it down there. The agent does not need to use soap bottle or faucet to clean the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "clean the object with the sink or sink basin"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a clean tomato in countertop"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see cabinet (1-6), microwave (1), countertop (1-2), coffeemachine (1), toaster (1), sink (1), sinkbasin (1), fridge (1)

**Answer Choices**
(1): go to cabinet 2
(2): go to cabinet 3
(3): go to microwave 1
(4): go to cabinet 4
(5): go to cabinet 5
(6): go to cabinet 6
(7): go to countertop 1
(8): go to coffeemachine 1
(9): go to toaster 1
(10): go to countertop 2
(11): go to sink 1
(12): go to sinkbasin 1
(13): go to fridge 1
(14): open cabinet 1
(15): close cabinet 1


**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.

Original Response:
First, we analyze the provided images. Both Image1 and Image2 appear to be the same, and they show a closed cabinet with no visible objects that can be identified as tomatoes or any other objects relevant to the task description.

Based on the task description "put a clean tomato in countertop" and the hint provided, the agent needs to find a tomato, clean it, and then place it on the countertop. Since no tomato is visible in the images, we need to search every place based on the Initial Observation to find the object.

The most reasonable action from the choices provided would be to first locate where the tomatoes are stored. Commonly, fresh tomatoes are stored in the fridge or on the countertop if they are to be used soon. Since the tomatoes need to be cleaned, it would be logical to first go to the fridge to check if there are any tomatoes there, and then proceed to clean them using the sink or sink basin before placing them on the countertop.

The answer is: (13): go to fridge 1.
