VLM Prompt:
Image1:

Image2:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a hot egg in countertop."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a microwave, heat the object with the microwave, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the microwave button or open the microwave to heat the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "heat the object with the microwave"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a hot egg in countertop"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**

**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.
----------------------------------------

----------------------------------------

Original Response:
Image 1 Analysis:
- There is a sink with a faucet, and what appears to be an egg in a holder and a spoon on the drying area of the sink.
- There are no other objects that are relevant to the task of heating an egg.

Image 2 Analysis:
- There are no visible objects in this image, it appears to be a close-up of a metallic surface with reflections.

Based on the task description and initial observation, the agent needs to find an egg, heat it in the microwave, and then place it on the countertop.

From Image 1, we can assume that the egg is already present at the sink. The next step would be to heat the egg with the microwave. Since the agent does not need to use the microwave button or open the microwave to heat the object, the most reasonable action would be to go to the microwave to perform the "heat the object with the microwave" action.

The answer is: (15): go to microwave 1.
