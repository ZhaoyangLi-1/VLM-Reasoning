VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
Image2:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a hot egg in countertop."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a microwave, heat the object with the microwave, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the microwave button or open the microwave to heat the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "heat the object with the microwave"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a hot egg in countertop"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

Original Response:
Image 1 depicts what appears to be a closed metallic cabinet, potentially a refrigerator or a similar appliance, as indicated by the handles and the reflections on the surface. Image 2 shows a wooden cabinet with closed doors.

Given the task description "put a hot egg in countertop" and the hint, the agent must first find an egg, heat it in the microwave, and then place it on the countertop. Since no egg is visible in the provided images, we must rely on the initial observation to guide our actions.

Based on the initial observation, eggs are likely to be found in the fridge (cabinet) or possibly in one of the kitchen cabinets if they are stored at room temperature.

The most reasonable action from the answer choices, considering the task and the initial observation, would be to first locate the egg. Therefore, the agent should go to the fridge (cabinet 1) to search for the egg.

The answer is: (1): go to cabinet 1.
