VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a hot egg in countertop."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a microwave, heat the object with the microwave, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the microwave button or open the microwave to heat the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "heat the object with the microwave"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a hot egg in countertop"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

Original Response:
Image1 Analysis:
- Visible household objects include a sink with a faucet, a pan's lid, a glass, a spoon, and a salt shaker.
- There is no egg visible in the image.
- The task description mentions putting a "hot egg" on the countertop, which implies the egg needs to be heated first.

Task Hint Analysis:
- The agent needs to find an egg, heat it in the microwave, and then place it on the countertop.
- The agent does not need to use the microwave button or open the microwave to heat the object.

Based on the Initial Observation:
- The agent is in a room with various cabinets, drawers, and appliances, including a microwave.
- The egg could potentially be in a cabinet, drawer, or the fridge.

Considering the task and the options available, the agent should first locate an egg. Since eggs are commonly stored in a fridge, the most reasonable action would be to check the fridge first.

The answer is: (40): go to fridge 1.
