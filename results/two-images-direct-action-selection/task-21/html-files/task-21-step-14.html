VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
Image2:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a hot cup in countertop."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a microwave, heat the object with the microwave, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the microwave button or open the microwave to heat the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "heat the object with the microwave"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a hot cup in countertop"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see cabinet (1-6), microwave (1), countertop (1-2), coffeemachine (1), toaster (1), sink (1), sinkbasin (1), fridge (1)

**Answer Choices**
(1): go to cabinet 1
(2): go to cabinet 3
(3): go to cabinet 4
(4): go to cabinet 5
(5): go to cabinet 6
(6): go to countertop 1
(7): go to coffeemachine 1
(8): go to toaster 1
(9): go to countertop 2
(10): go to sink 1
(11): go to sinkbasin 1
(12): go to fridge 1
(13): open cabinet 2
(14): close cabinet 2
(15): examine cabinet 2


**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.

Original Response:
Image Analysis:
Both Image 1 and Image 2 appear to be practically identical, showing a closed cabinet with no visible difference in the state of any objects. There is no cup visible in either image.

Task Analysis:
The task requires finding a cup, heating it in the microwave, and then placing it on the countertop. Since there is no cup visible in the provided images, the agent must search for one. The images do not show the microwave, coffeemachine, toaster, sink, sinkbasin, fridge, or the countertops, so the agent must explore these areas as well based on the "Initial Observation."

The most reasonable action to find a cup and accomplish the task would be to search the cabinets, as cups are commonly stored there. Since cabinet 2 appears in both images but is not an option to open in the answer choices, we must consider other cabinets.

The answer is: (1): go to cabinet 1, as it is the first cabinet that should be checked for the presence of a cup. If the cup is not found in cabinet 1, the agent should proceed to check other cabinets following the order of the answer choices.
