VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
Image2:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a hot cup in countertop."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a microwave, heat the object with the microwave, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the microwave button or open the microwave to heat the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "heat the object with the microwave"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a hot cup in countertop"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see cabinet (1-6), microwave (1), countertop (1-2), coffeemachine (1), toaster (1), sink (1), sinkbasin (1), fridge (1)

**Answer Choices**
(1): go to cabinet 3
(2): go to microwave 1
(3): go to cabinet 4
(4): go to cabinet 5
(5): go to cabinet 6
(6): go to countertop 1
(7): go to coffeemachine 1
(8): go to toaster 1
(9): go to countertop 2
(10): go to sink 1
(11): go to sinkbasin 1
(12): go to fridge 1
(13): open cabinet 2
(14): close cabinet 2
(15): examine cabinet 2


**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.

Original Response:
First, analyzing the images, we can see that they are identical and show a closed cabinet with no visible cup or any other object that can be heated in a microwave. Since there is no difference between the images and no visible cup, we have to search every place based on the initial observation.

We need to find an object of the desired type, which is a cup, so we should check places where a cup is likely to be found. Cabinets are common places to store cups. Since the task description doesn't specify a particular cabinet, we have to go through them one by one until we find a cup.

The answer is: (1): go to cabinet 3. If the cup is not found there, continue with (3): go to cabinet 4, and so on through the cabinets. Once the cup is found, we would then need to go to the microwave to heat it and then place it on the countertop.
