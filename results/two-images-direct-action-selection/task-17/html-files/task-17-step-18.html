VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
Image2:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a cool pan in stoveburner."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a cool pan in stoveburner"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see cabinet (1-14), countertop (1-2), microwave (1), drawer (1-5), sink (1), sinkbasin (1), coffeemachine (1), stoveburner (1-4), toaster (1), fridge (1), diningtable (1), garbagecan (1), safe (1)

**Answer Choices**
(1): go to cabinet 3
(2): go to countertop 1
(3): go to cabinet 5
(4): go to microwave 1
(5): go to cabinet 6
(6): go to drawer 1
(7): go to drawer 2
(8): go to drawer 3
(9): go to cabinet 7
(10): go to cabinet 8
(11): go to sink 1
(12): go to sinkbasin 1
(13): go to coffeemachine 1
(14): go to cabinet 9
(15): go to cabinet 10
(16): go to drawer 4
(17): go to cabinet 11
(18): go to stoveburner 1
(19): go to stoveburner 2
(20): go to stoveburner 3
(21): go to stoveburner 4
(22): go to cabinet 12
(23): go to toaster 1
(24): go to drawer 5
(25): go to countertop 2
(26): go to fridge 1
(27): go to cabinet 13
(28): go to cabinet 14
(29): go to diningtable 1
(30): go to garbagecan 1
(31): go to safe 1
(32): open cabinet 4
(33): close cabinet 4
(34): examine cabinet 4


**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.

Original Response:
Firstly, we need to identify all visible household objects in the images provided. In Image 1, there is no household object visible. In Image 2, we can see a microwave on countertop 1, and cabinet 4 is open.

Comparing the differences between the images, cabinet 4 in Image 2 is opened, which is relevant to the task description "put a cool pan in stoveburner." This indicates that the agent might have already searched cabinet 4 for the pan.

Considering the task hint, the agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, so we can exclude actions related to interacting with the fridge directly.

Now, analyzing the answer choices, we need to find a pan to put on the stoveburner. Cabinet 4 is already open, so we can exclude choices (32), (33), and (34). Since the agent must find a pan, it is likely to be in a cabinet or a drawer near the stove.

The most reasonable action for the task "put a cool pan in stoveburner" would be to first find a pan. As the agent has already searched cabinet 4, the next logical step would be to search nearby cabinets or drawers.

Based on Initial Observation, we will search every place to find the object, considering the proximity to the stoveburner. Cabinets are usually used to store pans, so we will prioritize them over drawers.

The answer is: (5): go to cabinet 6. This choice is close to the stoveburner and has not been searched yet, according to the information we have.
