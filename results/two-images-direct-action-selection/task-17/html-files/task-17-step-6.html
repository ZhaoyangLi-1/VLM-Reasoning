VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
Image2:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a cool pan in stoveburner."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a cool pan in stoveburner"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see cabinet (1-14), countertop (1-2), microwave (1), drawer (1-5), sink (1), sinkbasin (1), coffeemachine (1), stoveburner (1-4), toaster (1), fridge (1), diningtable (1), garbagecan (1), safe (1)

**Answer Choices**
(1): go to cabinet 2
(2): go to countertop 1
(3): go to cabinet 4
(4): go to cabinet 5
(5): go to microwave 1
(6): go to cabinet 6
(7): go to drawer 1
(8): go to drawer 2
(9): go to drawer 3
(10): go to cabinet 8
(11): go to sink 1
(12): go to sinkbasin 1
(13): go to coffeemachine 1
(14): go to cabinet 9
(15): go to cabinet 10
(16): go to drawer 4
(17): go to cabinet 11
(18): go to stoveburner 1
(19): go to stoveburner 2
(20): go to stoveburner 3
(21): go to stoveburner 4
(22): go to cabinet 12
(23): go to toaster 1
(24): go to drawer 5
(25): go to countertop 2
(26): go to fridge 1
(27): go to cabinet 13
(28): go to cabinet 14
(29): go to diningtable 1
(30): go to garbagecan 1
(31): go to safe 1
(32): open cabinet 1
(33): close cabinet 1
(34): examine cabinet 1


**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.

Original Response:
Firstly, we need to identify all visible household objects in the provided images. However, both Image 1 and Image 2 do not show any household objects; they only show a wooden surface, which could be a floor, cabinet, or countertop. There is no difference between the images as no objects are visible in either of them.

Based on the task description "put a cool pan in stoveburner," and considering the hint provided, the most reasonable action would be to find a pan and cool it with the fridge before placing it on the stoveburner. However, since there are no pans visible in the images, we need to search every place based on the initial observation to find the object.

Since the task is to put a "cool pan" in the stoveburner and the agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, the most logical location to find a pan would be in a cabinet or drawer where kitchen items are typically stored. Therefore, the most reasonable action from the answer choices would be to search the cabinets and drawers.

The answer is: (6): go to cabinet 6. This choice is selected because it is common for pans to be stored in kitchen cabinets, and cabinet 6 is one of the options provided. If cabinet 6 does not contain a pan, the agent can then proceed to search other cabinets and drawers based on their proximity and likelihood of containing a pan.
