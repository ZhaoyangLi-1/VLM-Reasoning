VLM Prompt:
Image1:

Image2:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a cool pan in stoveburner."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a cool pan in stoveburner"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see cabinet (1-14), countertop (1-2), microwave (1), drawer (1-5), sink (1), sinkbasin (1), coffeemachine (1), stoveburner (1-4), toaster (1), fridge (1), diningtable (1), garbagecan (1), safe (1)

(35): examine cabinet 7


**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.
----------------------------------------

Original Response:
First, analyze the provided images:
- In Image 1, there are no pans visible. We see a coffee machine, a loaf of bread, a knife, and a cup.
- In Image 2, we see a sink with a tomato and cup inside, and the same objects as in Image 1 minus the bread and knife.

Next, compare the difference between images:
- The loaf of bread and the knife seen in Image 1 are not present in Image 2.
- No other changes relevant to the task description are noticeable.

Considering the task description "put a cool pan in stoveburner" and the task hint, we need to find a pan, cool it with the fridge, and then place it on a stoveburner. Since no pan is visible in the images, we must search for one based on the Initial Observation list provided.

Based on the Initial Observation, we should first look inside the cabinets or drawers, as these are common storage places for pans. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, so actions related to the fridge are not immediately necessary.

The most reasonable action from the choices is to search the cabinets closest to the stoveburner, as this is where pans are commonly stored for easy access when cooking.

The answer is: (3): go to cabinet 3.
