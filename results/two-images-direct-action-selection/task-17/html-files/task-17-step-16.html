VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
Image2:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a cool pan in stoveburner."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a cool pan in stoveburner"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.

----------------------------------------

Original Response:
The provided images show a wooden surface, which could be interpreted as a countertop or a cabinet door. There are no visible household objects or any indication of a pan or stoveburner in either image.

Based on the task description "put a cool pan in stoveburner," the agent needs to find a pan, cool it with the fridge, and then place it on a stoveburner. Since there is no pan visible in the images, we should search every place based on the Initial Observation to find the object.

Considering the most likely locations for a pan, we would check the cabinets or drawers, as pans are typically stored there. The fridge is also mentioned for cooling the object, but we do not need to open the fridge as per the hint provided. Therefore, it is reasonable to start by checking the storage locations for a pan.

The answer is: (1): go to cabinet 2. This action is a reasonable starting point to search for a pan if we don't find it, we can move on to other cabinets or drawers.
