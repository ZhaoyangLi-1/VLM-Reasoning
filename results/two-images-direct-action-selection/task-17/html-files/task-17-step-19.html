VLM Prompt:

**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a cool pan in stoveburner."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a cool pan in stoveburner"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**

**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.
----------------------------------------

----------------------------------------

Original Response:
Firstly, we need to identify all visible household objects in the images. In both images, we can see a microwave on the countertop and a cabinet with one door open (cabinet 6). There's also a saltshaker and a butterknife on the countertop. There is no visible difference between the two images in terms of the objects' state (opened or taken on hand).

Now, according to the task description "put a cool pan in stoveburner," we need to find a pan, cool it with the fridge, and then put it on the stoveburner. Based on the task hint, we do not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object; we just need to perform the action "cool the object with the fridge."

Considering the **Initial Observation** and the visible objects in the images, there is no pan visible on the countertop or in the opened cabinet. Therefore, we need to search for the pan in other places.

The most reasonable action from the choices provided would be to search the cabinets and drawers, as these are typical storage places for pans in a household kitchen. Since we cannot see a pan in cabinet 6, we should look in the other cabinets and drawers.

The answer is: (1): go to cabinet 1.
