VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
Image2:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a cool pan in stoveburner."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a cool pan in stoveburner"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see cabinet (1-14), countertop (1-2), microwave (1), drawer (1-5), sink (1), sinkbasin (1), coffeemachine (1), stoveburner (1-4), toaster (1), fridge (1), diningtable (1), garbagecan (1), safe (1)

Original Response:
Image Analysis:
- Image1 shows a countertop with a microwave and some objects that do not resemble a pan.
- Image2 is not helpful as it shows an empty wall, providing no information about household objects.

Task Analysis:
The task is to put a cool pan in a stoveburner. The hint specifies that the agent must find a pan, cool it with the fridge, and then place it on a stoveburner. The agent does not need to interact with the fridge buttons or open the fridge.

Based on Initial Observation, the agent should first locate a pan. Common locations for pans would be in cabinets or drawers near the stove. The countertop and microwave are not holding a pan based on Image1. The agent should then go to the fridge to cool the pan and finally place it on a stoveburner.

Answer:
Since we do not see a pan in Image1 and Image2 is irrelevant, we should search the cabinets and drawers near the stove. The most reasonable next action would be to check the cabinets and drawers, as they are typical storage places for pans. Among the answer choices, the closest cabinets to the stove (assuming a typical kitchen layout with the stove near cabinets) would be cabinet 3 and cabinet 4. However, we should prioritize cabinet 3 as it is typically closer to the stoveburner's location in most kitchen layouts.

The answer is: (2): go to cabinet 3.
