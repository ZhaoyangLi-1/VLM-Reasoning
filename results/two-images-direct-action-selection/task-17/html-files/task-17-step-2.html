VLM Prompt:

**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a cool pan in stoveburner."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a cool pan in stoveburner"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

Original Response:
Firstly, we need to find a pan to put on the stoveburner. From the initial observation, we know that there are cabinets and drawers that typically contain such items. In both images provided, we can see a counter with cabinets below. However, no pan is visible on the countertop or inside the open cabinets. Therefore, the pan must be located in one of the cabinets or drawers that are not visible in the images.

Considering the task hint, the agent does not need to interact with the fridge other than to cool the object with it. Therefore, we can exclude options that involve going to or examining the fridge (option 28).

Based on the initial observation list, the most reasonable locations to search for a pan would be in the cabinets or drawers. Since the images show that the drawers and cabinets 1 to 3 are closed and we don't see a pan on the visible countertop (countertop 2), we need to search inside them.

The answer is: (4): go to countertop 1.
