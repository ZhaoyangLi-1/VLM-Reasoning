VLM Prompt:
Image1:

Image2:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "heat some tomato and put it in fridge."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a microwave, heat the object with the microwave, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the microwave button or open the microwave to heat the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "heat the object with the microwave"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "heat some tomato and put it in fridge"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

Original Response:
The task is to heat some tomato and put it in the fridge. There are no tomatoes visible in the provided images, just an apple on a wooden surface. Therefore, we must search for the tomato based on the initial observation.

Since tomatoes are typically stored in cabinets or fridges before being cooked, the most reasonable action would be to check these places first. The microwave will be used after acquiring the tomato to heat it, and finally, the heated tomato will be placed in the fridge.

The answer is: (2): go to cabinet 4.
