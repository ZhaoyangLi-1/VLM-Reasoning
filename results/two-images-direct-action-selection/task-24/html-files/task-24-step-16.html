VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
Image2:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "heat some tomato and put it in fridge."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a microwave, heat the object with the microwave, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the microwave button or open the microwave to heat the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "heat the object with the microwave"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "heat some tomato and put it in fridge"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see cabinet (1-14), countertop (1-2), microwave (1), drawer (1-5), sink (1), sinkbasin (1), coffeemachine (1), stoveburner (1-4), toaster (1), fridge (1), diningtable (1), garbagecan (1), safe (1)

**Answer Choices**
(1): go to cabinet 1
(2): go to countertop 1
(3): go to cabinet 4
(4): go to cabinet 5
(5): go to microwave 1
(6): go to cabinet 6
(7): go to drawer 1
(8): go to drawer 2
(9): go to drawer 3
(10): go to cabinet 7
(11): go to cabinet 8
(12): go to sink 1
(13): go to sinkbasin 1
(14): go to coffeemachine 1
(15): go to cabinet 9
(16): go to cabinet 10
(17): go to drawer 4
(18): go to cabinet 11
(19): go to stoveburner 1
(20): go to stoveburner 2
(21): go to stoveburner 3
(22): go to stoveburner 4
(23): go to cabinet 12
(24): go to toaster 1
(25): go to drawer 5
(26): go to countertop 2
(27): go to cabinet 13
(28): go to cabinet 14
(29): go to diningtable 1
(30): go to garbagecan 1
(31): go to safe 1
(32): open cabinet 3
(33): close cabinet 3
(34): put apple 1 in/on cabinet 3
(35): examine apple 1
(36): examine cabinet 3


**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.
----------------------------------------

----------------------------------------

Original Response:
The images provided show an apple on a wooden surface, which is not relevant to the task of heating a tomato and putting it in the fridge. Since there is no tomato visible in the images, we need to search for it based on the Initial Observation.

The task requires us to find a tomato, heat it in the microwave, and then put it in the fridge. We are not instructed to look for an apple or interact with it, so options (34), (35), and (36) are not relevant. Since the task does not mention opening or closing cabinets, (32) and (33) are also not relevant.

Considering the locations provided in the Initial Observation, the most reasonable action to find a tomato would be to search in places where food is typically stored, such as cabinets or the fridge.

The answer is: (1): go to cabinet 1
