VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
Image2:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a cool pot in cabinet."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a cool pot in cabinet"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see cabinet (1-20), countertop (1-3), coffeemachine (1), toaster (1), sink (1), fridge (1), microwave (1), garbagecan (1), drawer (1-3), sinkbasin (1), stoveburner (1-4), shelf (1-3)

(40): close cabinet 5
(41): examine cabinet 5


**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.

Original Response:
1. Analyze the images: In both Image1 and Image2, we can see the same view of what appears to be the doors of upper kitchen cabinets with handles. There is no visible difference between the two images; no objects are opened or taken in hand.

2. Task description analysis: The task is to put a cool pot in a cabinet. According to the task hint, the agent must find a pot, cool it with the fridge, then find the correct cabinet to place it in. The images provided do not show a pot or the inside of a fridge or cabinet, so we cannot determine the current status of the pot (whether it is already cooled or not) or the correct cabinet to place it in.

3. Answer: Since the images do not provide information about the pot or its location, we must rely on the initial observation to decide the next action. The most reasonable action would be to go to the fridge to cool the pot, as this is part of the task requirement before placing it in a cabinet. Therefore, the answer is: (11): go to fridge 1.
