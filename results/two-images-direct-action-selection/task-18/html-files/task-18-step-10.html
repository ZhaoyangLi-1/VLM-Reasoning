VLM Prompt:
Image1:

Image2:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a cool pot in cabinet."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a cool pot in cabinet"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**

**Answer Choices**
(1): go to cabinet 2
(2): go to cabinet 3
(3): go to cabinet 4
(4): go to cabinet 5
(5): go to cabinet 6

Original Response:
Image1 shows a red pot inside what appears to be a cabinet with a glass window, which could be the object we need to cool and put in a cabinet. There is no other household object visible in this image. Image2 shows a cabinet with closed doors and golden handles.

Since the task is to "put a cool pot in cabinet," and we have found a pot in Image1, the most reasonable action would be to first cool the pot with the fridge. However, according to the task hint, the agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge; the action is simply "cool the object with the fridge." After cooling the pot, the agent would then need to find the correct location to place it, which would be inside a cabinet.

Based on the Initial Observation, there are multiple cabinets (1-20) in the room. As the images do not provide clear cabinet numbering, we cannot determine which specific cabinet number the agent should go to place the cool pot. Since the task description does not specify which cabinet to put the cool pot in, we have to make an educated guess based on the available answer choices.

Considering the information above, the most reasonable action is to cool the pot first and then go to a cabinet to place it. However, since the cooling action is not explicitly mentioned in the answer choices, we can only select an action related to going to a cabinet.

The answer is: (1): go to cabinet 2. If cabinet 2 is not the correct cabinet to place the pot in, the agent should then search other cabinets based on the Initial Observation until the correct one is found.
