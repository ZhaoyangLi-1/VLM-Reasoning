VLM Prompt:
Image1:

Image2:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a cool pot in cabinet."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a cool pot in cabinet"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.

Original Response:
Image Analysis:
- In Image 1, we see two closed cabinets with gold-colored handles.
- In Image 2, we see the same view, but now the second cabinet from the left (cabinet 2) is open. There is no visible pot or any other objects inside this cabinet.

Task Hint Analysis:
- The task requires finding a pot, cooling it with the fridge, and then placing it in a cabinet.

Initial Observation:
- The initial observation lists various household objects and locations, including multiple cabinets, countertops, appliances, and other kitchen items.

Based on the images provided, we do not see a pot in the opened cabinet (cabinet 2). Since we need to find a pot, we should search other cabinets or locations where a pot might be stored. The images only show cabinet 2 opened, and it does not contain the desired object. Therefore, we should look in other cabinets.

The answer is: (1): go to cabinet 3. This choice is the next logical step to continue searching for a pot in the cabinets near the already opened cabinet 2. If cabinet 3 does not contain the pot, the agent should continue to search other cabinets or locations based on the initial observation until the pot is found.
