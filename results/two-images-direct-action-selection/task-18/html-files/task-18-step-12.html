VLM Prompt:
Image1:

Image2:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a cool pot in cabinet."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a cool pot in cabinet"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**

(39): close cabinet 5
(40): examine cabinet 5


**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.
----------------------------------------

----------------------------------------

Original Response:
Firstly, we analyze the images provided:
- In Image 1, we can see that cabinet 5 is open, and there is no pot or any object visible inside it.
- In Image 2, cabinet 5 is closed, and we still do not see any pot or object that can be associated with the task.

Since the task is to "put a cool pot in cabinet," we need to find a pot, cool it with the fridge, and then put it in a cabinet. From the initial observation, we know there is a fridge and multiple cabinets in the room.

Based on the task hint, the agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object. It just needs to do an action that is "cool the object with the fridge."

From the answer choices, the only action that involves interacting with the fridge is (10): go to fridge 1. Since we do not see the desired pot in the images, the most reasonable action would be to search the fridge, as it is a common place to find pots and the agent can cool the pot there as well.

The answer is: (10): go to fridge 1.
