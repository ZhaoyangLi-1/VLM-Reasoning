VLM Prompt:
Image1:

Image2:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a cool pot in cabinet."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a cool pot in cabinet"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

Original Response:
Image1:
- There is a red pot visible inside a cabinet with a glass door. The cabinet appears to be closed.

Image2:
- The cabinets in the image are fully closed, and we cannot see any objects inside them.

Based on the initial observation, we know there are multiple cabinets, countertops, and other objects in the room.

For the task "put a cool pot in cabinet," we need to find a pot, cool it with the fridge, and then put it in a cabinet. Since Image1 shows a pot inside a cabinet, this indicates that the pot might already be in a cabinet, but we don't know if it's cool or not. There is no action visible in the images of cooling the pot with the fridge or holding the pot in hand.

Considering the task hint, the agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object; the action is to "cool the object with the fridge." Since there is no visible fridge in either image, we cannot confirm if the agent has already cooled the pot. 

Given that we cannot see a fridge or the process of cooling the pot, we need to follow the initial observation and search for the fridge to cool the pot and then place it in the cabinet. Since we don't have information on which cabinet the pot needs to be placed in, we should look for a cabinet that hasn't been mentioned yet.

The answer is: (1): go to cabinet 2. This action does not directly relate to cooling the pot or putting it in a cabinet, but it is the most reasonable next step to search for the correct cabinet as cabinet 1 has already been mentioned in the choices and the pot is not in hand to be cooled or placed yet.
