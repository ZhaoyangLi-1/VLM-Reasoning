VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
Image2:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a cool apple in countertop."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a cool apple in countertop"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see microwave (1), countertop (1-2), cabinet (1-11), diningtable (1), drawer (1-3), sink (1), sinkbasin (1), toaster (1), stoveburner (1-4), fridge (1), coffeemachine (1), garbagecan (1)

**Answer Choices**
(1): go to microwave 1
(2): go to countertop 1
(3): go to cabinet 1
(4): go to diningtable 1
(5): go to drawer 1
(6): go to sink 1
(7): go to cabinet 2
(8): go to cabinet 3
(9): go to sinkbasin 1
(10): go to cabinet 4
(11): go to cabinet 5
(12): go to drawer 2
(13): go to countertop 2
(14): go to toaster 1
(15): go to cabinet 6
(16): go to stoveburner 1
(17): go to cabinet 7
(18): go to stoveburner 2
(19): go to stoveburner 3
(20): go to stoveburner 4
(21): go to drawer 3
(22): go to cabinet 8
(23): go to cabinet 9
(24): go to cabinet 10
(25): go to coffeemachine 1
(26): go to cabinet 11
(27): go to garbagecan 1
(28): open fridge 1
(29): close fridge 1
(30): put apple 1 in/on fridge 1
(31): examine apple 1


**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.

Original Response:
The task is to put a cool apple on the countertop. From the initial observation, we can see that there is a fridge mentioned, which is relevant for cooling the apple. In the provided images, we can see an apple on the countertop, which is the object we need to cool and then place back on the countertop.

However, we do not need to use the fridge's button or open the fridge in this scenario, as the instruction states that the agent just needs to perform the action "cool the object with the fridge." Therefore, we can skip actions related to opening or closing the fridge.

Out of the answer choices provided, the only action that seems relevant to the task of cooling the apple and then putting it on the countertop is:

(30): put apple 1 in/on fridge 1

Since the instruction does not require us to physically open the fridge, we assume that the action of "putting" the apple in/on the fridge will simulate the cooling process.

The answer is: (30): put apple 1 in/on fridge 1.
