<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a cool apple in countertop."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a cool apple in countertop"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

Original Response:
First, we need to find an apple, which is not visible in the provided images. Therefore, we should search the locations where an apple might be found, such as cabinets, drawers, or the countertop.

Next, we are instructed to cool the apple with the fridge, but we do not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to do so. As per the task description, the agent just needs to perform an action that is "cool the object with the fridge."

Finally, we need to put the cool apple on the countertop. Since the task specifies "put a cool apple in countertop," the most reasonable action would be to go to the countertop after cooling the apple with the fridge.

Since we do not have an apple in the images and we need to search for it, we should first go to a likely location where we might find an apple, such as the cabinet or the drawer. However, since there are no actions listed for searching or picking up an apple, we will select the action that aligns with the final step of the task, which is placing the apple on the countertop.

The answer is: (13): go to countertop 2.
