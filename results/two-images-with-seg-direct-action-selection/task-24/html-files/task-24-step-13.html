Original Response:
The task is to "put a hot tomato in fridge." To accomplish this task, the agent must first find a tomato, which is likely to be stored in a cabinet or a fridge. Then, the agent needs to heat the tomato with the microwave and finally place it in the fridge.

From Image1 and Image2, we can see the labels "cabinet 1," "cabinet 2," "cabinet 3," and "cabinet 8." Since these are the only visible cabinets in the images, we must search for the tomato in these cabinets first. The task does not require us to use the microwave button or open the microwave, so we can skip that step. 

Once we have the tomato, the next step would be to go to the fridge to complete the task. However, the fridge is not visible in the provided images, so we must rely on the **Initial Observation** which indicates that there is a "fridge (1)" in the room.

Considering all this information, the most reasonable first action to complete the task would be to search the cabinets for the tomato.

The answer is: (1): go to cabinet 3.
