**Instruction**

Original Response:
The task is to "put a hot tomato in fridge," which means we need to find a tomato, heat it in the microwave, and then place it in the fridge.

From the initial observation, we know there's a microwave (1) and a fridge (1) in the room, but the image does not show any tomatoes. Since the image is not helpful in locating the tomato, we need to search all possible locations where a tomato might be stored based on the initial observation.

Cabinets and drawers are common places to store food items, so it would be best to check them first. Since there is no specific information on where the tomato might be, and the image does not show one, we should start with the closest storage area and search systematically.

The answer is: (1): go to cabinet 1
