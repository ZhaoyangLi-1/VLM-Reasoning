Original Response:
Firstly, we need to identify the relevant objects for the task "find two kettle and put them in cabinet." In the provided images, we can see one kettle labeled "kettle 1" on the countertop. Since the task requires finding two kettles, and we can only see one, the next step would be to search other places to find the second kettle.

Based on the initial observation, we know there are cabinets, drawers, and other household areas that have not been visually inspected yet. Since kettles are commonly stored in cabinets, the most reasonable action would be to start searching the cabinets.

The answer is: (2): go to cabinet 1
