Original Response:
The task is to find two kettles and put them in a cabinet. The image provided only shows a countertop, a sink, a sink basin, and a few items such as a bowl and a spoon, but no kettles are visible. According to the initial observation, there are several cabinets and drawers in the room, so checking the cabinets would be a logical next step to find the kettles. 

The answer is: (3): go to cabinet 1. If no kettle is found there, the agent should proceed to check the other cabinets and drawers sequentially until two kettles are found.
