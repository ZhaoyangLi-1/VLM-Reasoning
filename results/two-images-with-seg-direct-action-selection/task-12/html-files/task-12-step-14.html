<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided image to identify all visible household objects, focusing on those relevant to the task description "clean some tomato and put it in countertop."
2. Use the analysis of the image and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a sink or a basin, clean the object with a sink or basin, and then find the correct location to place it and put it down there. The agent does not need to use soap bottle or faucet to clean the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "clean the object with the sink or sink basin"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "clean some tomato and put it in countertop"?
4. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in the image, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

Original Response:
First, we are looking for a tomato to clean and put on the countertop. Looking at the initial observation, there is no mention of a tomato being in sight, which means we may need to search for it. 

The task description does not specify where the tomato is located, but a common place to store fresh produce like tomatoes would be in the fridge or a cabinet. 

Based on the options provided, we cannot go directly to the fridge, so we should check the cabinets first. Cabinet 1 is already open as per Image 2, and there's no tomato visible, so we can eliminate options related to cabinet 1.

The most logical next step would be to check the other cabinets for the tomato. Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is: (1): go to cabinet 2.
