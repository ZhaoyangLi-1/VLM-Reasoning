VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
Image2:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided image to identify all visible household objects, focusing on those relevant to the task description "clean some tomato and put it in countertop."
2. Use the analysis of the image and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a sink or a basin, clean the object with a sink or basin, and then find the correct location to place it and put it down there. The agent does not need to use soap bottle or faucet to clean the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "clean the object with the sink or sink basin"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "clean some tomato and put it in countertop"?
4. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in the image, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see cabinet (1-6), microwave (1), countertop (1-2), coffeemachine (1), toaster (1), sink (1), sinkbasin (1), fridge (1)

**Answer Choices**
(1): go to cabinet 3
(2): go to microwave 1
(3): go to cabinet 4
(4): go to cabinet 5
(5): go to cabinet 6
(6): go to countertop 1
(7): go to coffeemachine 1
(8): go to toaster 1
(9): go to countertop 2
(10): go to sink 1
(11): go to sinkbasin 1
(12): open fridge 1
(13): close fridge 1
(14): take apple 1 from fridge 1
(15): take potato 1 from fridge 1
(16): examine fridge 1

**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.

Original Response:
The task is to "clean some tomato and put it in countertop." The first step is to find a tomato. Looking at the images provided, none of the cabinets (cabinet 1, cabinet 2, cabinet 3) in Image1 contain visible objects, and the fridge (fridge 1) in Image2 contains an apple (apple 1) and a potato (potato 1), but no tomato.

Since we cannot see a tomato in the provided images, we need to search every place based on the Initial Observation. The places that could contain a tomato are cabinets 1-6 and the fridge 1. Since the cabinets in Image1 are empty and fridge 1 in Image2 does not contain a tomato, the most reasonable action would be to search the remaining cabinets that are not visible in the images.

The answer is: (3): go to cabinet 4
