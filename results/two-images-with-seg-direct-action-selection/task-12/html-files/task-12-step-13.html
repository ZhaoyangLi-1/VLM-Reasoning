VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
Image2:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided image to identify all visible household objects, focusing on those relevant to the task description "clean some tomato and put it in countertop."
2. Use the analysis of the image and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a sink or a basin, clean the object with a sink or basin, and then find the correct location to place it and put it down there. The agent does not need to use soap bottle or faucet to clean the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "clean the object with the sink or sink basin"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "clean some tomato and put it in countertop"?
4. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in the image, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see cabinet (1-6), microwave (1), countertop (1-2), coffeemachine (1), toaster (1), sink (1), sinkbasin (1), fridge (1)

**Answer Choices**
(1): go to cabinet 1
(2): go to cabinet 3
(3): go to microwave 1
(4): go to cabinet 5
(5): go to cabinet 6
(6): go to countertop 1
(7): go to coffeemachine 1
(8): go to toaster 1
(9): go to countertop 2
(10): go to sink 1
(11): go to sinkbasin 1
(12): open cabinet 4
(13): close cabinet 4
(14): examine cabinet 4

**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.

Original Response:
First, we need to find a tomato to clean. The tomato is not visible in the provided images, so we need to search for it based on the Initial Observation. We know there are cabinets (1-6) in the room, so the tomato might be stored in one of them. 

The task description does not specify which countertop to place the tomato on after cleaning, so we can choose either countertop 1 or countertop 2. 

Since the images do not show a tomato and we need to search for it, the most reasonable action would be to go to one of the cabinets to find the tomato. Cabinet 4 and cabinet 5 are visible in image 2, but they are closed, so we cannot determine if the tomato is inside without opening them. 

Based on the provided choices and the task hint that we do not need to interact with cabinet 4 (as the actions are to open, close, or examine it), we should check the other cabinets that are not visible in the images. 

The answer is: (1): go to cabinet 1
