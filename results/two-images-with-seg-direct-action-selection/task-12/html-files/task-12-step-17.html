VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
Image2:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided image to identify all visible household objects, focusing on those relevant to the task description "clean some tomato and put it in countertop."
2. Use the analysis of the image and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a sink or a basin, clean the object with a sink or basin, and then find the correct location to place it and put it down there. The agent does not need to use soap bottle or faucet to clean the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "clean the object with the sink or sink basin"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "clean some tomato and put it in countertop"?
4. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in the image, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see cabinet (1-6), microwave (1), countertop (1-2), coffeemachine (1), toaster (1), sink (1), sinkbasin (1), fridge (1)

**Answer Choices**
(1): go to cabinet 1
(2): go to cabinet 3
(3): go to microwave 1
(4): go to cabinet 4
(5): go to cabinet 5
(6): go to cabinet 6
(7): go to countertop 1
(8): go to coffeemachine 1
(9): go to toaster 1
(10): go to countertop 2
(11): go to sink 1
(12): go to sinkbasin 1
(13): open fridge 1
(14): close fridge 1
(15): take apple 1 from fridge 1
(16): take potato 1 from fridge 1
(17): examine fridge 1

**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.

Original Response:
The task is to "clean some tomato and put it in countertop." From the initial observation, we know there is a fridge (1) in the room. Looking at the provided images, we see inside of the fridge (1), and there are two objects labeled: "potato 1" and "apple 1". There is no tomato visible inside the fridge.

Since the task is to find a tomato, we need to search for it. The image analysis does not help us locate a tomato, so we must follow the initial observation to search every place.

The most reasonable action to find the tomato would be to open cabinets as tomatoes are often stored at room temperature rather than in a fridge. Starting with cabinet 1 seems like a logical first step as it is commonly the first place to search in a sequence.

The answer is: (1): go to cabinet 1.
