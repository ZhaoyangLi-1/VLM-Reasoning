VLM Prompt:
Image1:

Image2:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided image to identify all visible household objects, focusing on those relevant to the task description "cool some pan and put it in stoveburner."
2. Use the analysis of the image and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "cool some pan and put it in stoveburner"?
4. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in the image, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

Original Response:
The task is to cool some pan and put it in a stoveburner. Since we are not given a visual of all the cabinets or drawers, we must assume the pan could be in any of them. However, the task also indicates that we need to cool the object with the fridge. Therefore, the first logical step would be to obtain the pan from a likely location.

Based on the initial observation, cabinets and drawers are common places to find pans. Since the image does not show a pan on the countertops or inside the microwave, we can exclude those options. 

The answer is: (26): go to fridge 1. This action aligns with the task requirement of cooling the pan, which is the first specific action mentioned in the task description. After cooling the pan with the fridge, the next logical action would be to go to a stoveburner.
