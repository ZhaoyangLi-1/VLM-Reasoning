VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
Image2:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided image to identify all visible household objects, focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a cool pot in cabinet."
2. Use the analysis of the image and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a cool pot in cabinet"?
4. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in the image, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

Original Response:
The task is to "put a cool pot in cabinet." From the initial observation, we know there's only one fridge (fridge 1) to cool the pot. However, there is no pot visible in the provided images. Therefore, we need to search every place based on the initial observation to find the pot.

Since the images show cabinet 1, cabinet 4, and cabinet 5, these are the only cabinets visible, and there is no pot in them. We need to go to the other cabinets to find the pot.

The answer is: (16): go to cabinet 11, as it is the next cabinet in numerical order after those visible in the images, and we need to search for the pot.
