VLM Prompt:

<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided image to identify all visible household objects, focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a cool apple in countertop."
2. Use the analysis of the image and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a cool apple in countertop"?
4. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in the image, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

Original Response:
The task is to put a cool apple on the countertop. Based on the information provided, the agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object. However, the agent needs to find an apple first, then cool it with the fridge, and finally place it on the countertop.

From the Initial Observation, we know there is a fridge (1) in the room. Since the images provided do not show any apples, we have to search every place based on the Initial Observation to find the apple.

Given that none of the answer choices directly suggest searching for an apple or cooling an object with the fridge, we must choose the action that is the next best step towards completing the task. The most reasonable next action would be to go to the fridge to cool the apple once it is found.

The answer is: (16): go to fridge 1.
