Original Response:
Firstly, the task is to put a "cool apple" in countertop. This means the agent must find an apple, cool it using the fridge, and then place it on the countertop.

From the initial observation, we know there is a fridge (fridge 1) and two countertops (countertop 1 and countertop 2) in the room. The images provided show countertop 1, sink 1, sinkbasin 1, cabinet 2, cabinet 3, countertop 2, toaster 1, drawer 2, cabinet 5, and fridge 1. However, there is no apple visible in either of the images.

According to the task hint, the agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object. The agent just needs to "cool the object with the fridge." Since there is no apple in sight, the agent must search every place based on the initial observation to find the apple.

Once the apple is found, the most reasonable next action would be to go to fridge 1 to cool the apple. After cooling the apple, the agent should go to either countertop 1 or countertop 2 to place the cool apple.

Since the task description specifies "put a cool apple in countertop" without specifying which countertop, and countertop 1 is visible in the image, we will select the action that involves going to countertop 1 to complete the task.

The answer is: (2): go to countertop 1
