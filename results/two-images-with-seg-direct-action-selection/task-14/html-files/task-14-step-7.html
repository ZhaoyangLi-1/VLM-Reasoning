Original Response:
First, we need to find an apple, which is not visible in the provided images. According to the initial observation, we should search cabinets, drawers, and the fridge where an apple is likely to be stored. 

Next, we must cool the apple with the fridge. Since we don't need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, we can skip actions related to opening or closing the fridge.

Finally, we need to put the cool apple on the countertop. Since the task description specifically mentions "countertop," we should prioritize going to one of the countertops over other surfaces.

Based on the initial observation, the most reasonable actions to follow the task description would be to search the cabinets and drawers for an apple, then go to the fridge to cool it, and finally place it on a countertop. 

The answer is: (3): go to cabinet 1. If the apple is not there, continue searching the cabinets and drawers, then go to the fridge (29): examine fridge 1, and finally, go to a countertop (2): go to countertop 1 to place the cool apple.
