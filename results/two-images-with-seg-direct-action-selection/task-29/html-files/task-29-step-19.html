Original Response:
Image1 shows a tomato on countertop 2. The task is to find two tomatoes and put them on the countertop. Since one tomato is already visible, the next action should be to search for another tomato. 

Image2 does not show any tomatoes but provides a view of cabinet 1. According to the Initial Observation, there are many cabinets to search.

Since neither of the provided images shows a second tomato, the most logical action would be to search the cabinets based on the Initial Observation, starting with the ones not yet viewed (as we have already seen inside cabinet 1, and cabinet 4 in Image1, and there is no tomato).

The answer is: (1): go to cabinet 2.
