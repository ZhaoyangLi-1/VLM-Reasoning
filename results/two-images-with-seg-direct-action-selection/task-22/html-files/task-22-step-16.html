Original Response:
The task is to "put a hot egg in countertop." The image analysis does not show any eggs, but we have the initial observation that there are multiple cabinets, countertops, a sink, drawers, a coffee machine, a microwave, a garbage can, stove burners, a toaster, and a fridge in the room.

According to the task hint, we need to find an egg, heat it with the microwave, then place it on a countertop. Since the images provided do not show any eggs, we should search every place based on the initial observation to find the object.

The most reasonable first action would be to search for the egg, which could be in the fridge or cabinets, as these are common storage places for eggs. Since the fridge is visible in the images and does not contain an egg, we should check the cabinets next. 

The answer is: (1): go to cabinet 2.
