Original Response:
The task is to "put a hot apple in garbagecan." The hint informs us that the agent must find the apple, heat it with the microwave, and then put it in the garbagecan. 

From the image provided, we can see a countertop with a fork and two objects that resemble an apple and a potato. Since the apple is the object of interest, we should focus on the countertop.

Given the Initial Observation, we know there is a garbagecan (1) and a microwave (1) in the room. 

First, the agent would need to pick up the apple from the countertop (1), heat it with the microwave (15), and then put it in the garbagecan (21). Since the image already shows the apple on the countertop (1), the next logical action would be to heat it with the microwave (15).

Therefore, The answer is: (15): go to microwave 1.
