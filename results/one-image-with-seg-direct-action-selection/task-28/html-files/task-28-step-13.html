Original Response:
First, we identify all visible household objects relevant to the task. In the image, there is one visible spray bottle labeled "spraybottle 1" on the countertop 1. 

According to the task, we need to find two spray bottles and put them in the toilet. Since we can only see one spray bottle in the image, we need to search for another one. The initial observation lists different places we can search, including drawers. 

The most reasonable action to start with would be to search in places where the second spray bottle might be located, which could be inside drawers since they are often used for storage. 

Therefore, the answer is: (12): open drawer 3.
