Original Response:
First, we need to identify all visible household objects related to the task. In the image provided, we can see one spray bottle on the countertop. According to the task description, we need to find two spray bottles and put them in the toilet. Since we can see one spray bottle already, our next step is to find another one.

Based on the initial observation, we can search in places where a spray bottle might be kept. The most reasonable places to look for another spray bottle would be in drawers or on the cart, as these are typical storage areas for cleaning supplies in a bathroom.

Therefore, the most reasonable action to take first would be to search the drawers. Since we don't know which drawer might contain the spray bottle, we should start with the first one.

The answer is: (13): open drawer 1. If a spray bottle is found, we can then proceed to (11): go to toilet 1 to complete the task. If no spray bottle is found in drawer 1, we would continue searching the other drawers or the cart.
