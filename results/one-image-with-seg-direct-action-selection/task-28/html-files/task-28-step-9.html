Original Response:
First, we analyze the image and identify a spray bottle labeled "spraybottle 1" on the countertop. According to the task, we need to find two spray bottles and put them in the toilet. Since we already see one, we need to look for another. Based on the initial observation, we should search in places where a spray bottle could be, such as drawers or a cart. 

The most reasonable action from the choices given, considering we need to find another spray bottle, would be to search the drawers since they are common storage places for such items. 

The answer is: (13): open drawer 2, as this action will allow us to search for the second spray bottle. If we find it, we can proceed to put both in the toilet as per the task description. If drawer 2 doesn't contain a spray bottle, we can then check the other drawers.
