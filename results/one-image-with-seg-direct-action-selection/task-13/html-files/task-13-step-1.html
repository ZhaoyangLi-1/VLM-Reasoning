VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided image to identify all visible household objects, focusing on those relevant to the task description "clean some tomato and put it in garbagecan."
2. Use the analysis of the image and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a sink or a basin, clean the object with a sink or basin, and then find the correct location to place it and put it down there. The agent does not need to use soap bottle or faucet to clean the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "clean the object with the sink or sink basin"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "clean some tomato and put it in garbagecan"?
4. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in the image, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

Original Response:
Firstly, we need to identify any visible household objects relevant to the task of cleaning a tomato and putting it in the garbage can. In the image provided, we can see a fridge labeled as "fridge 1" and a garbage can labeled as "garbagecan 1." However, there is no visible tomato or sink/sinkbasin.

Based on the initial observation, there is a sinkbasin and a sink available in the room but not visible in the image. Since we need to clean the tomato, our first step would be to find a tomato. Since there is no visible tomato in the image, we would need to search around the room.

The most logical place to find a tomato would be in the fridge or a cabinet where food is typically stored. Since the fridge is visible in the image, we should first check there.

The answer is: (28): open fridge 1
