VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided image to identify all visible household objects, focusing on those relevant to the task description "clean some tomato and put it in garbagecan."
2. Use the analysis of the image and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a sink or a basin, clean the object with a sink or basin, and then find the correct location to place it and put it down there. The agent does not need to use soap bottle or faucet to clean the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "clean the object with the sink or sink basin"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "clean some tomato and put it in garbagecan"?
4. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in the image, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

Original Response:
The task is to clean a tomato and put it in the garbagecan. From the image, we can see a tomato on the countertop and a sink with a sinkbasin next to it. The garbagecan is also visible in the image. The agent does not need to use the faucet, so we can ignore that part of the instructions.

Given the task description and the objects in the image, the most reasonable action would be to first clean the tomato with the sink or sinkbasin and then put it in the garbagecan. Looking at the answer choices, the action that matches this task is:

(29): clean tomato 1 with sink 1

After cleaning the tomato, the next reasonable action would be to put it in the garbagecan:

(5): go to garbagecan 1

The answer is: (29): clean tomato 1 with sink 1, followed by (5): go to garbagecan 1.
