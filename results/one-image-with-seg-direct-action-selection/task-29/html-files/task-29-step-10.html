Original Response:
The task description is to "find two tomato and put them in countertop." 

Analyzing the provided image, there are no tomatoes visible in the fridge. The visible items are egg 1, potato 1, and mug 1.

Based on the Initial Observation, there are multiple cabinets, drawers, and a fridge that could potentially contain tomatoes.

Since the image shows the inside of the fridge and there are no tomatoes there, the most reasonable next action would be to search the cabinets as they are common storage places for non-refrigerated items like tomatoes.

The answer is: (1): go to cabinet 1, as it is the first cabinet to search through. If no tomatoes are found there, the agent should proceed to the next cabinets sequentially until the tomatoes are found. Once two tomatoes are found, the agent should then go to the countertop to place them there as per the task description.
