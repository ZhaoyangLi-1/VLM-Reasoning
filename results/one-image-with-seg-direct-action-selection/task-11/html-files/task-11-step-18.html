Original Response:
The task is to put a clean soapbar in bathtubbasin. Since there is no soapbar visible in the image, the most reasonable action is to search for the soapbar in places where it might usually be stored. Among the available choices, cabinet 1 and cabinet 2 are the most likely places to find a soapbar. Cabinet 2 is already open and we can see its contents, which don't include a soapbar. Therefore, we should check cabinet 1.

The answer is: (4): go to cabinet 1
