VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided image to identify all visible household objects, focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a cool tomato in microwave."
2. Use the analysis of the image and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a cool tomato in microwave"?
4. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in the image, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Answer**

Original Response:
The task is to put a cool tomato in the microwave, which implies that the agent first needs to find a tomato and then cool it using the fridge before placing it in the microwave. From the image provided, we can see cabinet 1, but we cannot determine if there is a tomato inside it or not.

Based on the **Initial Observation**, we know there are multiple cabinets (1-15), a fridge, countertops, drawers, a microwave, and other household objects in the room. Since the image only shows cabinet 1 and we cannot confirm the presence of a tomato, the agent must search every place to find the object.

The first logical step would be to search the cabinets, as they are common storage places for food items like tomatoes. Therefore, the most reasonable action from the choices would be to go to the next cabinet in sequence to continue the search.

The answer is: (2): go to cabinet 2.
