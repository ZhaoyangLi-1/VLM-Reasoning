Original Response:
The task is to put a cool tomato in the microwave. Since the image shows microwave 1 and countertop 1, but no tomato, we need to look for the tomato. Based on the initial observation, tomatoes are most likely to be found in a cabinet or fridge. However, we are instructed that we do not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, so we'll skip that step. 

Since there's no visible tomato, we should start by searching the cabinets, as that's the most common place to find a tomato in a kitchen. We'll start with the cabinet closest to the microwave and countertop, which is cabinet 11, as labeled in the image.

The answer is: (15): go to cabinet 11
