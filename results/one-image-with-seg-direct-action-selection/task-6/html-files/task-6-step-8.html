VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided image to identify all visible household objects, focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a cd in safe."
2. Use the analysis of the image and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, find the correct location to place it, and put it down there." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a cd in safe"?
4. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in the image, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see bed (1-2), dresser (1), sidetable (1-2), drawer (1-11), desk (1), garbagecan (1), safe (1)

Original Response:
The task is to "put a cd in safe." The image shows a sidetable with two drawers, but neither of them is open. There is no visible CD in the image, so we must search for it based on the Initial Observation. The most reasonable action would be to search the drawers that have not been opened yet to find a CD. Since drawer 1 is already open and does not contain a CD, we can eliminate options 18-25. The safe is also an option, but since we do not have the CD yet, going to the safe (option 17) would not be the most reasonable action at this moment.

The answer is: (6): go to drawer 3, as it is the next logical step to search for the CD based on the Initial Observation list.
