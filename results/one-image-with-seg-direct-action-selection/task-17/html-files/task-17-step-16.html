Original Response:
First, we need to identify a pan in the image to cool it. There is a pan labeled "pan 1" on the countertop 2. According to the task hint, we do not need to interact with the fridge directly, so we can skip going to the fridge 1. After cooling the pan, we need to put it in a stoveburner. In the image, we can see "stoveburner 1" right next to the pan. 

The most reasonable action from the choices provided for the task description "cool some pan and put it in stoveburner" is to put the already visible pan 1 in the stoveburner 1.

The answer is: (21): go to stoveburner 1.
