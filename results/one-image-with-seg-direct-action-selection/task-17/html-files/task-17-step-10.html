VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided image to identify all visible household objects, focusing on those relevant to the task description "cool some pan and put it in stoveburner."
2. Use the analysis of the image and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "cool some pan and put it in stoveburner"?
4. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in the image, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

Original Response:
First, we need to identify the pan to cool it. In the image, we can see an object labeled "pan 1", which is the object we need for the task. The next step is to go to the fridge to cool the pan; however, the instruction specifies that the agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and just needs to do the action "cool the object with the fridge". After cooling the pan, we need to place it on a stoveburner.

Considering the available answer choices, there are no actions directly stating to cool the pan with the fridge. However, we have options to approach different stoveburners. Since the task is to put the cooled pan on a stoveburner, the most reasonable action is to go to one of them.

The answer is: (20): go to stoveburner 1
