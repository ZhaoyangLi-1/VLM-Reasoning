**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided image to identify all visible household objects, focusing on those relevant to the task description "clean some tomato and put it in countertop."
2. Use the analysis of the image and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a sink or a basin, clean the object with a sink or basin, and then find the correct location to place it and put it down there. The agent does not need to use soap bottle or faucet to clean the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "clean the object with the sink or sink basin"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "clean some tomato and put it in countertop"?
4. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in the image, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see cabinet (1-6), microwave (1), countertop (1-2), coffeemachine (1), toaster (1), sink (1), sinkbasin (1), fridge (1)

**Answer Choices**

Original Response:
First, we need to find a tomato, which is most likely to be inside the fridge. So the first action would be to go to the fridge to get the tomato.

After acquiring the tomato, the next step is to clean it. The image shows a sink and a sink basin that can be used for this purpose. Since the agent does not need to use a soap bottle or faucet, they just need to perform the action of cleaning the tomato with the sink or sink basin.

Finally, after cleaning the tomato, the agent needs to put it on the countertop. The image shows two countertops, labeled as countertop 1 and countertop 2.

Based on the **Initial Observation** and the image provided, the most reasonable sequence of actions would be:
- Go to the fridge to get the tomato (14).
- Clean the tomato with the sink or sink basin (12 or 13).
- Put the cleaned tomato on the countertop (8 or 11).

Since we need to select one action for the task description "clean some tomato and put it in countertop," we will choose the first logical step:

The answer is: (14): go to fridge 1.
