VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided image to identify all visible household objects, focusing on those relevant to the task description "clean some tomato and put it in countertop."
2. Use the analysis of the image and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a sink or a basin, clean the object with a sink or basin, and then find the correct location to place it and put it down there. The agent does not need to use soap bottle or faucet to clean the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "clean the object with the sink or sink basin"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "clean some tomato and put it in countertop"?
4. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in the image, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see cabinet (1-6), microwave (1), countertop (1-2), coffeemachine (1), toaster (1), sink (1), sinkbasin (1), fridge (1)

**Answer Choices**
(1): go to cabinet 1
(2): go to cabinet 2
(3): go to cabinet 3
(4): go to microwave 1
(5): go to cabinet 4
(6): go to cabinet 5
(7): go to cabinet 6
(8): go to countertop 1
(9): go to coffeemachine 1
(10): go to toaster 1
(11): go to countertop 2
(12): go to sink 1
(13): go to sinkbasin 1
(14): close fridge 1
(15): take apple 1 from fridge 1
(16): take potato 1 from fridge 1
(17): examine fridge 1

**Answer**
Let's think step by step by following the instructions.

Original Response:
The task is to clean some tomato and put it on the countertop. In the provided image, there is no tomato visible inside the fridge, only a potato and an apple. Therefore, the agent must search every place based on the initial observation to find the tomato.

Since tomatoes are not typically stored in appliances like microwaves, coffee machines, or toasters, it is reasonable to exclude those locations. Cabinets and countertops are common storage places for tomatoes. The sink or sink basin will be needed to clean the tomato once it is found.

Given the information provided, the most reasonable action would be to start searching the cabinets for a tomato. Starting with cabinet 1 seems like a logical first step, as it is often the convention to start with the first in a series.

The answer is: (1): go to cabinet 1.
