Original Response:
First, we identify the relevant objects in the image for the task "cool some apple and put it in countertop." We can see an apple on countertop 2 and a fridge labeled fridge 1. The task hint tells us that the agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge; they only need to perform the action "cool the object with the fridge."

Based on the provided image and the task description, the most reasonable action would be to:
- Pick up the apple from countertop 2
- Cool the apple with the fridge
- Place the cooled apple back on a countertop

The answer choices do not include picking up the apple or cooling it with the fridge, but we can choose the action that involves going to the countertop since it is the final step of the task.

The answer is: (13): go to countertop 2, to pick up the apple and then cool it with the fridge as per the task hint, and place it back on the countertop.
