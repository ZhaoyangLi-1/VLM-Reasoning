Original Response:
The task is to cool some apple and put it on the countertop. The image provides a view of the fridge, countertop 2, and cabinet 5. Since the agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, the agent just needs to do an action that is "cool the object with the fridge."

The image does not show an apple, so the agent must search every place based on the Initial Observation to find the object. Once the apple is found, the agent should go to the fridge to cool it. After cooling the apple, the agent should then go to the countertop to place it down.

Based on the Initial Observation, there are multiple countertops, but countertop 2 is visible in the image. Since the task is to put the cooled apple on a countertop, we can assume that we should choose the visible countertop.

The answer is: (13): go to countertop 2
