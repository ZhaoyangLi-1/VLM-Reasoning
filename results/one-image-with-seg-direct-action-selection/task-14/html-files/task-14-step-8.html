**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided image to identify all visible household objects, focusing on those relevant to the task description "cool some apple and put it in countertop."
2. Use the analysis of the image and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "cool some apple and put it in countertop"?
4. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in the image, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

Original Response:
The task is to cool an apple and put it on the countertop. Since the image does not show any apples, we must look in places where an apple might be stored, such as a fridge or a cabinet. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge, so the action of going to the fridge is the most reasonable to cool the apple. After cooling the apple, the agent should then place it on the countertop.

The answer is: (15): go to fridge 1
