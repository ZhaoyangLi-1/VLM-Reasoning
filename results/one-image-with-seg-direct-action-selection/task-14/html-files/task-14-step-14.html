Original Response:
The task is to cool some apple and put it in countertop. From the image provided, we can see apple 1 on countertop 2. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, which means we do not need to focus on fridge-related actions. 

Looking at the answer choices, none of them directly involve cooling the apple with the fridge. However, the task description implies that the apple needs to be picked up and then cooled. The only action that involves picking up the apple is choice (31): take apple 1 from countertop 2.

Therefore, the most reasonable action from the choices provided to accomplish the task of cooling the apple would be to first take the apple. After that, we can assume the agent will cool the apple with the fridge as per the task hint.

The answer is: (31): take apple 1 from countertop 2.
