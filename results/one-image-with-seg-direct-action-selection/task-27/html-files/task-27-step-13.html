Original Response:
The task is to find two soapbottles and put them in the garbagecan. From the image, we can see that there is one soapbottle (soapbottle 1) visible on the countertop. Since the task requires two soapbottles, we first need to collect the visible one and then search for another. The most reasonable action would be to go to the location of the visible soapbottle, which is on the countertop, and pick it up.

The answer is: (1): go to countertop 1
