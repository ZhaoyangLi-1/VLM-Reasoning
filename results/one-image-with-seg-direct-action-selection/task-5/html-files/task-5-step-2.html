Original Response:
The task is to "put some book on armchair." From the image provided, we cannot see any books. However, based on the initial observation, we know there are drawers and a dresser in the room that could potentially contain a book.

The most reasonable action would be to search the drawers and dresser for a book since they are typical storage places for such items. Therefore, we should examine drawer 1 as the first step to finding a book because it is not stated that the agent has already searched there.

The answer is: (20): examine drawer 1. If a book is found, the agent can then proceed to "go to armchair 1" and complete the task.
