Original Response:
The task is to "put some book on armchair." From the provided image, we can see a sofa with a box on it but no armchair or book in sight. However, based on the initial observation, there is an armchair (1) mentioned in the room.

Since the task is to put a book on the armchair and we cannot see any book in the image, we need to search for a book. Books are usually found in drawers, sidetables, or dressers. Therefore, we should check these locations to find a book.

Considering the answer choices, we should first go to a location where books are most likely to be found. Drawers, sidetables, and dressers are good places to start.

The answer is: (4): go to drawer 1. If a book is not found there, continue searching the other drawers, sidetables, and the dresser as per the initial observation.
