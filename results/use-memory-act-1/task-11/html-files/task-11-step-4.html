VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to clean some soapbar and put it in bathtubbasin. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a soap bar.
2. Pick up the soap bar.
3. Find a sink or basin.
4. Clean the soap bar with the sink or basin.
5. Find a bathtub basin.
6. Place the cleaned soap bar in the bathtub basin.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
Current State 1:
1. Place: Unspecified
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: Countertop, Sink
4. Action: Go to cabinet 1
Current State 2:
1. Place: Cabinet 1
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: Countertop, Sink, Soap Bar
4. Action: Open cabinet 1
Current State 3:
1. Place: Countertop next to the sink
2. Step Index in Plan: 2
3. Objects: Soap bar
4. Action: Go to countertop 1
Current State 4:
1. Place: Countertop next to the sink
2. Step Index in Plan: 2
3. Objects: Soap bar
4. Action: Take soapbar 1 from countertop 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to bathtub 1
(2): go to bathtubbasin 1
(3): go to toilet 1
(4): go to cabinet 1
(5): go to sink 1
(6): go to sinkbasin 1
(7): go to cabinet 2
(8): go to garbagecan 1
(9): put soapbar 1 in/on countertop 1
(10): examine soapbar 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the **History Information** and determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation.
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".
6. The most appropriate action must be in the **Admissible Actions**, and we cannot generate a new action that is not in the **Admissible Actions**.

**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: According to the History Information, we are currently at step 3 of the plan, which is to find a sink or basin and clean the soap bar. The current observation shows us at a countertop next to a sink with the soap bar in proximity. Since the goal of the current step is to clean the soap bar using a sink or basin, and we are already next to a sink, we can complete this step with the current observation. The sink is visible and accessible, thus we do not need to move to another location to find a sink or basin.

The Most Appropriate Action: (6): go to sinkbasin 1
