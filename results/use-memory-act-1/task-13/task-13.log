VLM Response:
Analysis: Since there is no history available, we are at the first step of the plan, which is to find a tomato. The current observation shows a sink basin and a garbage can, but no tomato is visible. Therefore, we cannot complete the first step with the current observation. We need to move to a location where we might find a tomato, such as a countertop, cabinet, or fridge.

VLM Response:
Analysis: According to the History Information, the current step in the plan is to find a tomato, which is step 1. Our current place is the kitchen. The Current Observation image does not show any visible objects related to the task, as it seems to be a close-up of a surface or an object, indicating the AI agent's camera may be facing the wrong direction or too close to an object. Consequently, we cannot complete the step with the current observation. The most appropriate action would be to move to a location where tomatoes are commonly found, such as a countertop or fridge. Since the AI agent has already gone to the fridge, the next logical location to check would be the countertop.

The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to countertop 1

VLM Response:
Analysis: Based on the History Information, we are currently at step 1 of the plan, which is to find a tomato. We are located in the kitchen. From the current observation, there are no tomatoes visible. We have previously gone to the fridge and a countertop, but we have not found a tomato yet. The admissible actions suggest that we can go to various cabinets, the garbage can, toaster, sink, microwave, another countertop, drawers, stove burners, coffee machine, dining table, and we can also take a plate, pan or bread from the countertop. Since we are looking for a tomato, it would be logical to check the cabinets where tomatoes might be stored, or the countertop if tomatoes are out in the open.

The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to cabinet 1

This action is chosen because tomatoes are often stored in cabinets or on countertops in a kitchen, and we have not yet checked cabinet 1.

Analysis: According to the history information, the agent is currently on step 1 of the plan, which is to find a tomato. From the current observation, the objects visible are a pot, a pan, a knife, a cup, and a pepper shaker. The history indicates that the agent has already explored various cabinets and countertops but has not yet located a tomato. Since no tomato is visible in the current observation, the agent cannot complete step 1 with the current observation. Therefore, the agent should continue searching for a tomato by exploring more cabinets or areas where a tomato might be found.

VLM Response:
Analysis: From the history information, we have completed step 1 of the plan which was to find a tomato. We are currently at step 2 which is to pick up the tomato. Our current place is the kitchen, as indicated by the current observation. The visible objects related to the task in the current observation are the sink basin and the toaster, but the tomato is not visible. According to history information, we encountered a tomato at Current State 6 and Current State 7. Given that the tomato is not in the current observation, we cannot complete step 2 with the current observation. We need to go back to where we last saw the tomato to pick it up.

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: From the history information, we have completed step 1 of the plan which was to find a tomato. We are currently at step 2 which is to pick up the tomato. Our current place is the kitchen, as indicated by the current observation. The visible objects related to the task in the current observation are the sink basin and the toaster, but the tomato is not visible. According to history information, we encountered a tomato at Current State 6 and Current State 7. Given that the tomato is not in the current observation, we cannot complete step 2 with the current observation. We need to go back to where we last saw the tomato to pick it up.

Analysis: Based on the History Information, we are currently at step 2 of the plan, which is to pick up the tomato. The current place is at the sink basin, as the last action taken was "go to cabinet 2" and the observation shows the sink. The visible objects related to the task in the current observation are the sink basin and the toaster. Since we are at step 2, we need to find and pick up the tomato. The current observation does not show a tomato; therefore, we cannot complete the step with the current observation. The most appropriate action would be to go to a location where a tomato might be found based on the previous history. Since the tomato was last mentioned in a cabinet, the best course of action is to go to a different cabinet that has not been checked yet.

VLM Response:
Analysis: Based on the History Information, we are currently at step 2 of the plan, which is "Pick up the tomato." Our current place is the kitchen, specifically near the sink basin, as indicated by the current observation image. Looking at the current observation, we can see a sink basin and a toaster, but the tomato is not visible. Since the tomato was last seen when the agent was instructed to "Open cabinet 2" and no action has been taken since to pick up the tomato, we can assume that the tomato is still inside the opened cabinet 2. Therefore, we cannot complete step 2 with the current observation as we need to locate the tomato first. The most appropriate action would be to go to the cabinet where the tomato was last seen to pick it up.

VLM Response:
Analysis: According to the history information, we are currently at step 2 of the plan, which is to pick up the tomato. The current observation shows a sink basin, which is relevant to step 3 of the plan but not step 2. The tomato is not visible in the current observation, suggesting that it might be in a different location, possibly in a cabinet or on a countertop, as per the historical data. Therefore, we cannot complete step 2 with the current observation. We need to find the tomato before we can proceed to clean it. Since we have previously opened cabinet 3 and 4 without finding the tomato, it would be logical to try another cabinet or countertop that has not been checked yet.

Therefore, we cannot complete step 2 with the current observation. We need to find the tomato before we can proceed to clean it. Since we have previously opened cabinet 3 and 4 without finding the tomato, it would be logical to try another cabinet or countertop that has not been checked yet.

The Most Appropriate Action: (2): go to cabinet 1

VLM Response:
Analysis: Based on the History Information, we are currently at step 2 of the plan, which is to pick up the tomato. The current place is near the sink basin. In the current observation, the visible objects related to the task are the sink basin and a dirty pan. Since our objective is to put a clean tomato in the garbage can, and we have already found the tomato in previous steps, the next step is to clean the tomato. However, the current observation does not show the tomato; it only shows a dirty pan in the sink basin. Therefore, we cannot complete the step with the current observation. The most appropriate action would be to go to the location where we previously found the tomato (cabinet 3 from Current State 6) as it is not visible in the current observation and we need to pick it up to proceed with cleaning.

VLM Response:
Analysis: According to the history information, we are currently at step 2 in the plan, which is to pick up the tomato. In the current observation, we can see the sink basin, which indicates that we are near the sink. The history states that there is a tomato near the sink basin, which is our object of interest. Since we need to pick up the tomato and the observation shows that we are near the sink basin where the tomato is located, we can complete this step. The most appropriate action is to pick up the tomato, but such action is not listed in the admissible actions. Therefore, the closest action we can take to progress would be to go to the sink, which may allow us to interact with the tomato.

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the **History Information** and determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation.
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".
6. The most appropriate action must be in the **Admissible Actions**, and we cannot generate a new action that is not in the **Admissible Actions**.

**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: According to the history information, we are currently at step 2 in our plan, which involves picking up the tomato. The current observation shows us near the sink basin with a dirty pan in view. Since our task is to pick up a tomato, and the tomato is not visible in the current observation but was previously seen near the sink basin, we should examine our surroundings to locate the tomato. The most appropriate action is to take the next step towards finding and picking up the tomato. However, none of the admissible actions directly indicate an action to pick up the tomato. The closest relevant action is to go to cabinet 3, where the tomato was last observed according to the history. 

The Most Appropriate Action: (3): go to cabinet 3
