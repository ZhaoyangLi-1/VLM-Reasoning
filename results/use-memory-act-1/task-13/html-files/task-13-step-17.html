**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the **History Information** and determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation.
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".
6. The most appropriate action must be in the **Admissible Actions**, and we cannot generate a new action that is not in the **Admissible Actions**.

**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: Based on the History Information, we are currently at step 2 of the plan, which is to pick up the tomato. The current place is near the sink basin. In the current observation, the visible objects related to the task are the sink basin and a dirty pan. Since our objective is to put a clean tomato in the garbage can, and we have already found the tomato in previous steps, the next step is to clean the tomato. However, the current observation does not show the tomato; it only shows a dirty pan in the sink basin. Therefore, we cannot complete the step with the current observation. The most appropriate action would be to go to the location where we previously found the tomato (cabinet 3 from Current State 6) as it is not visible in the current observation and we need to pick it up to proceed with cleaning.

The Most Appropriate Action: (2): go to cabinet 2
