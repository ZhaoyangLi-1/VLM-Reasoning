VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to find two dishsponge and put them in cart. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a dish sponge.
2. Pick up the dish sponge.
3. Locate a cart.
4. Place the picked-up dish sponge in the cart.
5. Find another dish sponge.
6. Pick up the second dish sponge.
7. Return to the previously located cart.
8. Place the second picked-up dish sponge in the cart with the first one.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
Current State 1:
1. Place: Bathroom
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: Dish sponge, sink, shelves
4. Action: Go to shelf 4
Current State 2:
1. Place: Bathroom
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: Paper towel roll, toilet paper, soap bar
4. Action: go to shelf 1
Current State 3:
1. Place: Shelf 4 in the bathroom
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: Dish sponge
4. Action: Go to shelf 2
Current State 4:
1. Place: Shelf 1, 2, or 4 (exact shelf not specified in context)
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: Dish sponge
4. Action: Go to shelf 3


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to bathtub 1
(2): go to bathtubbasin 1
(3): go to cart 1
(4): go to toilet 1
(5): go to garbagecan 1
(6): go to toiletpaperhanger 1
(7): go to shelf 4
(8): go to sink 1
(9): go to sinkbasin 1
(10): go to handtowelholder 1
(11): take papertowelroll 1 from shelf 3
(12): take toiletpaper 1 from shelf 3
(13): take soapbar 1 from shelf 3

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the **History Information** and determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation.
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".
6. The most appropriate action must be in the **Admissible Actions**, and we cannot generate a new action that is not in the **Admissible Actions**.

**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: According to the History Information, our current step in the plan should be Step 2, "Pick up the dish sponge," since the previous actions were all "Go to shelf" actions in search of the dish sponge. The current place seems to be Shelf 3, as inferred from the History Information, and the current observation shows a dish sponge on the middle shelf. We have found the dish sponge required for Step 1 and can now proceed to pick it up to complete Step 2.

The Most Appropriate Action: (11): take papertowelroll 1 from shelf 3

**Note**: The provided admissible actions do not include an action to pick up a dish sponge. However, action (11) mentions taking a papertowelroll from shelf 3, which could be a mislabeling of the intended action to pick up the dish sponge, seeing as the dish sponge is the only object visible on shelf 3 in the current observation. If this is not the case, there may be an error in the admissible actions, as none of them allow for the dish sponge to be picked up. If it's an error and action (11) is indeed for a papertowelroll, the correct action cannot be determined from the given admissible actions, and further clarification would be needed.
