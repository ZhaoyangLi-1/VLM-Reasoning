VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to find two dishsponge and put them in cart. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a dish sponge.
2. Pick up the dish sponge.
3. Locate a cart.
4. Place the picked-up dish sponge in the cart.
5. Find another dish sponge.
6. Pick up the second dish sponge.
7. Return to the previously located cart.
8. Place the second picked-up dish sponge in the cart with the first one.

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the **History Information** and determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation.
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".
6. The most appropriate action must be in the **Admissible Actions**, and we cannot generate a new action that is not in the **Admissible Actions**.

**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: Based on the History Information, we are currently at Step 3 in the plan, which is to locate a cart. The current observation shows that we are already near a cart, as there is one visible in the image. The objects related to the task in the current observation are a paper towel roll and a cloth, which are inside the cart. From the history, it is clear that we have already picked up a dish sponge (Step 2 completed) and are now supposed to place it in the cart (Step 4). However, the current observation does not show the dish sponge in our possession, and the history does not confirm that we have picked it up. We must ensure that we have the dish sponge before we can place it in the cart. As the admissible actions do not include picking up or placing the dish sponge, we may need to locate it again (Step 1).

The Most Appropriate Action: (8): go to shelf 3

This action is chosen because, according to the history, shelf 3 is where we last saw the dish sponge, and we need to confirm if we have it before proceeding to place it in the cart.
