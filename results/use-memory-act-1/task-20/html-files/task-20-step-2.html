VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to put a hot apple in garbagecan. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find an apple.
2. Pick up the apple.
3. Find a microwave.
4. Heat the apple with the microwave.
5. Find a garbage can.
6. Place the heated apple in the garbage can.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
Current State 1:
1. Place: Unspecified (no specific location given in the context)
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: Apple, Tray, Sink
4. Action: go to sink 1
Current State 2:
1. Place: Sink
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: Apple 1, Sink 1
4. Action: Take apple 1 from sink 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to cabinet 1
(2): go to cabinet 2
(3): go to countertop 1
(4): go to cabinet 3
(5): go to cabinet 4
(6): go to cabinet 5
(7): go to cabinet 6
(8): go to drawer 1
(9): go to drawer 2
(10): go to sinkbasin 1
(11): go to cabinet 7
(12): go to cabinet 8
(13): go to coffeemachine 1
(14): go to microwave 1
(15): go to cabinet 9
(16): go to countertop 2
(17): go to cabinet 10
(18): go to drawer 3
(19): go to drawer 4
(20): go to garbagecan 1
(21): go to drawer 5
(22): go to cabinet 11
(23): go to cabinet 12
(24): go to cabinet 13
(25): go to cabinet 14
(26): go to stoveburner 1
(27): go to countertop 3
(28): go to stoveburner 2
(29): go to stoveburner 3
(30): go to stoveburner 4
(31): go to drawer 6
(32): go to cabinet 15
(33): go to cabinet 16
(34): go to cabinet 17
(35): go to cabinet 18
(36): go to toaster 1
(37): go to drawer 7
(38): go to countertop 4
(39): go to fridge 1
(40): put apple 1 in/on sink 1
(41): clean apple 1 with sink 1
(42): clean apple 1 with sinkbasin 1
(43): examine apple 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the **History Information** and determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation.
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".
6. The most appropriate action must be in the **Admissible Actions**, and we cannot generate a new action that is not in the **Admissible Actions**.

**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: Based on the History Information, we have completed Step 2 of the plan, which was to pick up the apple. The current observation shows an apple on the tray next to the sink, indicating that we are still at the sink and ready to move onto Step 3 of the plan, which is to find a microwave. The objects related to the task in the current observation are the apple and the sink. Since we have the apple, we can now proceed to find a microwave to heat the apple. 

The Most Appropriate Action: (14): go to microwave 1
