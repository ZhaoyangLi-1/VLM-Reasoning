VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to look at alarmclock under the desklamp. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find an alarm clock.
2. Pick up the alarm clock.
3. Find a desk lamp.
4. Turn on the desk lamp.
5. Position the alarm clock under the light of the desk lamp.
6. Look at the alarm clock under the desk lamp.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.

**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to bed 1
(2): go to sidetable 1
(3): go to drawer 1
(4): go to dresser 1
(5): go to drawer 2
(6): go to drawer 4
(7): go to drawer 5
(8): go to drawer 6
(9): go to drawer 7
(10): go to drawer 8
(11): go to drawer 9
(12): go to drawer 10
(13): go to drawer 11
(14): go to safe 1
(15): go to laundryhamper 1
(16): go to garbagecan 1
(17): open drawer 3
(18): close drawer 3
(19): put cellphone 1 in/on drawer 3
(20): examine cellphone 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the **History Information** and determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation.
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".
6. The most appropriate action must be in the **Admissible Actions**, and we cannot generate a new action that is not in the **Admissible Actions**.

**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: Based on the History Information, we are currently at step 2 in the plan, which is to pick up the alarm clock. Our current place is at the desk. The visible objects related to the task in the current observation are the alarm clock and the desk lamp. We can complete step 2 with the current observation, as the alarm clock is visible on the desk. Therefore, the most appropriate action to take next is to pick up the alarm clock.

The Most Appropriate Action: Since the admissible actions do not include an action to "pick up the alarm clock," we must choose the closest action that would allow us to interact with the alarm clock. The only admissible action that allows interaction with an object is "(19): put cellphone 1 in/on drawer 3," which does not align with our current objective. However, the lack of an appropriate action seems to be an oversight, as we need an action to pick up the alarm clock to proceed with the plan.

Given the constraints, the most appropriate action from the admissible actions is to open drawer 3 as it is the only action that allows us to interact with the environment and possibly reveal more actions that could include picking up the alarm clock.

The Most Appropriate Action: (17): open drawer 3
