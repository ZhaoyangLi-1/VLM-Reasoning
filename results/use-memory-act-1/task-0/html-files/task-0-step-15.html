**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to bed 1
(2): go to sidetable 1
(3): go to drawer 1
(4): go to dresser 1
(5): go to drawer 3
(6): go to drawer 4
(7): go to drawer 5

(16): go to garbagecan 1
(17): open drawer 2
(18): close drawer 2
(19): put cellphone 1 in/on drawer 2
(20): examine cellphone 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the **History Information** and determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation.
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".
6. The most appropriate action must be in the **Admissible Actions**, and we cannot generate a new action that is not in the **Admissible Actions**.

**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: Based on the History Information, our current step in the plan is step 2, which is to pick up the alarm clock. The current place is at the desk. The visible objects related to the task in the current observation are the desk and the desk lamp. The alarm clock is not visible in the current observation, which means we cannot complete the current step with the current observation. Since the history shows that we have already attempted to interact with drawer 2 without success in finding the alarm clock, we should try to look elsewhere. The most appropriate action would be to continue searching for the alarm clock by opening other drawers that have not been explored yet.

The Most Appropriate Action: (5): go to drawer 3
