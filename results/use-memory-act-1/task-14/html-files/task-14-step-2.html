VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to put a cool apple in countertop. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find an apple.
2. Pick up the apple.
3. Find a fridge.
4. Cool the apple with the fridge.
5. Find a countertop.
6. Place the cooled apple on the countertop.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
Current State 1:
1. Place: Unspecified location with two sinks, a glass, and a curtain
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: Two sinks, a glass, curtain
4. Action: Go to fridge 1
Current State 2:
1. Place: Next to fridge 1
2. Step Index in Plan: Step 2
3. Objects: Fridge 1
4. Action: Open fridge 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to microwave 1
(2): go to countertop 1
(3): go to cabinet 1
(4): go to diningtable 1
(5): go to drawer 1
(6): go to sink 1
(7): go to cabinet 2
(8): go to cabinet 3
(9): go to sinkbasin 1
(10): go to cabinet 4
(11): go to cabinet 5
(12): go to drawer 2
(13): go to countertop 2
(14): go to toaster 1
(15): go to cabinet 6
(16): go to stoveburner 1
(17): go to cabinet 7
(18): go to stoveburner 2
(19): go to stoveburner 3
(20): go to stoveburner 4
(21): go to drawer 3
(22): go to cabinet 8
(23): go to cabinet 9
(24): go to cabinet 10
(25): go to coffeemachine 1
(26): go to cabinet 11
(27): go to garbagecan 1
(28): open fridge 1
(29): close fridge 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the **History Information** and determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation.
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".
6. The most appropriate action must be in the **Admissible Actions**, and we cannot generate a new action that is not in the **Admissible Actions**.

**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: Based on the History Information, we are currently at step 2 in the plan, which is "Pick up the apple." The last recorded action was opening fridge 1, which implies we are next to fridge 1. The Current Observation shows the fridge door slightly ajar, so we are still at the fridge. Since the task requires us to cool the apple with the fridge, and there are no apples visible in the current observation, we cannot complete the current step with the current observation. Therefore, the most appropriate action is to open the fridge completely to look for an apple inside.

The Most Appropriate Action: (28): open fridge 1
