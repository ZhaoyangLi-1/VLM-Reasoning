VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to put some laptop on desk. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a laptop.
2. Pick up the laptop.
3. Find a desk.
4. Place the picked-up laptop on the desk.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
Current State 1:
1. Place: Unknown room
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: Sidetable, book, CD, garbage can, door
4. Action: Go to sidetable 1
Current State 2:
1. Place: Sidetable 1
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: Book, CD
4. Action: Go to desk 1
Current State 3:
1. Place: Desk 1
2. Step Index in Plan: 2
3. Objects: Alarm clock, cellphone, pencil, pen
4. Action: Go to drawer 1
Current State 4:
1. Place: Near Drawer 1
2. Step Index in Plan: 2
3. Objects: Sidetable, book, CD, mirror, bed, desk, items on desk
4. Action: Open drawer 1
Current State 5:
1. Place: Room
2. Step Index in Plan: 2
3. Objects: Sidetable, CD, Book, Drawer 1
4. Action: Go to drawer 4
Current State 6:
1. Place: Near Drawer 1
2. Step Index in Plan: 2
3. Objects: Desk, Alarm clock, Cellphone
4. Action: Open drawer 4
Current State 7:
1. Place: Room with Desk 1
2. Step Index in Plan: 2
3. Objects: Alarm clock, cellphone
4. Action: Go to drawer 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to bed 1
(2): go to garbagecan 1
(3): go to desk 1
(4): go to sidetable 1
(5): go to drawer 2
(6): go to laundryhamper 1
(7): go to drawer 3
(8): go to drawer 5
(9): open drawer 1
(10): close drawer 1
(11): take book 1 from drawer 1
(12): take cd 1 from drawer 1
(13): take pen 1 from drawer 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the **History Information** and determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation.
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".
6. The most appropriate action must be in the **Admissible Actions**, and we cannot generate a new action that is not in the **Admissible Actions**.

**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to pick up the laptop, which means we have already found the laptop as per step 1. In the current observation, we don't see any laptop in the immediate view, but we see a sidetable with a CD and a book on it, and a mirror reflecting a bed and what seems to be a desk with objects on it. The history suggests we've already looked in drawers and around the room without finding the laptop. Therefore, the laptop might be in a place not yet checked or visible in the mirror's reflection. The best course of action is to go to the area that we can see in the mirror's reflection, which seems to contain a desk, as that is a likely place to find a laptop. 

The Most Appropriate Action: (3): go to desk 1
