VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to put some laptop on desk. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a laptop.
2. Pick up the laptop.
3. Find a desk.
4. Place the picked-up laptop on the desk.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
Current State 1:
1. Place: Unknown room
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: Sidetable, book, CD, garbage can, door
4. Action: Go to sidetable 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to bed 1
(2): go to garbagecan 1
(3): go to desk 1
(4): go to drawer 1
(5): go to drawer 2
(6): go to laundryhamper 1
(7): go to drawer 3
(8): go to drawer 4
(9): go to drawer 5
(10): take book 1 from sidetable 1
(11): take lightswitch 1 from sidetable 1
(12): take cd 1 from sidetable 1
(13): take pen 1 from sidetable 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the **History Information** and determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation.
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".
6. The most appropriate action must be in the **Admissible Actions**, and we cannot generate a new action that is not in the **Admissible Actions**.

**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The History Information indicates that we are at Step Index 1 in the plan, which is to find a laptop. The action taken was to go to sidetable 1. In the Current Observation, we can see a sidetable with a book and a CD on it, but no laptop is visible. Therefore, we have not yet completed Step 1 of the plan, as we have not found a laptop. The admissible actions do not include any direct interaction with a laptop, so we must move to another location to find it. The most appropriate action would be to go to a desk, as laptops are commonly placed on desks.

The Most Appropriate Action: (3): go to desk 1

The Most Appropriate Action: (3): go to desk 1

**Summary Format**
1. Place: [Specify the current location]
2. Step Index in Plan: [Dispkay the current step number in the plan before taking the current action]
3. Objects: [List the objects relevant to the task]
4. Action: [Describe the most appropriate action without the "(x)" and keep the integer of the object]

Please analyze the **Context** and summarize the analysis using the **Summary Format**.

Summarization Response:
1. Place: Sidetable 1
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: Book, CD
4. Action: Go to desk 1
