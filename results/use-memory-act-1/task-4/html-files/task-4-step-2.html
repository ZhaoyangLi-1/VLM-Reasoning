VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to look at statue under the floorlamp. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a statue.
2. Pick up the statue.
3. Locate a floorlamp.
4. Turn on the floorlamp.
5. Stand under the floorlamp with the statue in hand.
6. Look at the statue while standing under the floorlamp.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
Current State 1:
1. Place: Unknown
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
4. Action: go to armchair 1
Current State 2:
1. Place: Unknown
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: Houseplant, Sidetable, Armchair, Small Object (potential statue)
4. Action: Take houseplant 1 from armchair 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to coffeetable 1
(2): go to sidetable 1
(3): go to garbagecan 1
(4): go to drawer 1
(5): go to sofa 1
(6): go to coffeetable 2
(7): go to diningtable 1
(8): put houseplant 1 in/on armchair 1
(9): examine houseplant 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the **History Information** and determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation.
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".
6. The most appropriate action must be in the **Admissible Actions**, and we cannot generate a new action that is not in the **Admissible Actions**.

**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current step in the plan is step 1: Find a statue. In the current observation, we see a houseplant and an armchair, but no statue is visible. According to the history information, a small object (potential statue) was previously noted near an armchair, but the agent took the houseplant instead. We need to locate the statue, so examining areas where small objects might be found, such as tables, would be logical. "Go to sidetable 1" is the most relevant action as it corresponds to the current observation where the sidetable is visible and might hold the statue.

The Most Appropriate Action: (2): go to sidetable 1

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: The current step in the plan is step 1: Find a statue. In the current observation, we see a houseplant and an armchair, but no statue is visible. According to the history information, a small object (potential statue) was previously noted near an armchair, but the agent took the houseplant instead. We need to locate the statue, so examining areas where small objects might be found, such as tables, would be logical. "Go to sidetable 1" is the most relevant action as it corresponds to the current observation where the sidetable is visible and might hold the statue.

The Most Appropriate Action: (2): go to sidetable 1

**Summary Format**
1. Place: [Specify the current location]
2. Step Index in Plan: [Dispkay the current step number in the plan before taking the current action]
3. Objects: [List the objects relevant to the task]
4. Action: [Describe the most appropriate action without the "(x)" and keep the integer of the object]

Please analyze the **Context** and summarize the analysis using the **Summary Format**.

Summarization Response:
1. Place: Room with houseplant and armchair
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: Houseplant, Armchair, Sidetable 1
4. Action: Go to sidetable 1

-----------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Text Observation:You arrive at loc 2. On the sidetable 1, you see a statue 1, and a pen 1.
