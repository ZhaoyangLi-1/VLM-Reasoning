VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to look at statue under the floorlamp. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a statue.
2. Pick up the statue.
3. Locate a floorlamp.
4. Turn on the floorlamp.
5. Stand under the floorlamp with the statue in hand.
6. Look at the statue while standing under the floorlamp.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
Current State 1:
1. Place: Unknown
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
4. Action: go to armchair 1
Current State 2:
1. Place: Unknown
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: Houseplant, Sidetable, Armchair, Small Object (potential statue)
4. Action: Take houseplant 1 from armchair 1
Current State 3:
1. Place: Room with houseplant and armchair
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: Houseplant, Armchair, Sidetable 1
4. Action: Go to sidetable 1
Current State 4:
1. Place: Room with a houseplant and armchair
2. Step Index in Plan: 2
3. Objects: Statue, Houseplant 1, Sidetable 1
4. Action: Put houseplant 1 in/on sidetable 1
Current State 5:
1. Place: Unspecified
2. Step Index in Plan: 4
3. Objects: Statue, Floorlamp
4. Action: Go to coffeetable 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to armchair 1
(2): go to garbagecan 1
(3): go to drawer 1
(4): go to sofa 1
(5): go to coffeetable 2
(6): go to diningtable 1
(7): put houseplant 1 in/on coffeetable 1
(8): examine houseplant 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the **History Information** and determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation.
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".
6. The most appropriate action must be in the **Admissible Actions**, and we cannot generate a new action that is not in the **Admissible Actions**.

**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to look at the statue while standing under the floorlamp. We have previously located the statue and the floorlamp, and the last action was to go to the coffeetable, which is not directly related to our current objective. The current observation shows a television, which is not relevant to our task. Therefore, we need to locate the floorlamp again to complete our plan. None of the admissible actions directly relate to the floorlamp, but "go to coffeetable 2" could potentially bring us closer to the floorlamp if it is situated near the coffeetable. Given that the last recorded action was to go to coffeetable 1, and there is no action to turn on the floorlamp or stand under it, we should move to a different location in hopes of finding the floorlamp again.

The Most Appropriate Action: (5): go to coffeetable 2
