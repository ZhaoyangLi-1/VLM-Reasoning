VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to clean some tomato and put it in countertop. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a tomato.
2. Pick up the tomato.
3. Find a sink or basin.
4. Clean the tomato with the sink or basin.
5. Find a countertop.
6. Place the cleaned tomato on the countertop.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
Current State 1:
1. Place: Kitchen (specific location not provided, but observation is of a sink)
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: Sink, Cabinets, Countertop, Fridge
4. Action: Go to fridge 1
Current State 2:
1. Place: In front of the fridge
2. Step Index in Plan: 2
3. Objects: Fridge, alphabet magnets, pictures
4. Action: Open fridge 1
Current State 3:
1. Place: Shelf
2. Step Index in Plan: Current step before taking the action
3. Objects: Tomato
4. Action: Take tomato 1 from shelf 1
Current State 4:
1. Place: Not specified (only mentions a shelf where a tomato was taken from)
2. Step Index in Plan: 3
3. Objects: Tomato, Potato
4. Action: Go to sinkbasin 1
Current State 5:
1. Place: Sink/Basin
2. Step Index in Plan: 4
3. Objects: Potato 1, Tomato (not present but required), Sink/Basin 1
4. Action: Put potato 1 in/on sinkbasin 1
Current State 6:
1. Place: Sink
2. Step Index in Plan: 4
3. Objects: Tomato, Potato, Faucet, Sink/Basin
4. Action: Take faucet 1 from sinkbasin 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to cabinet 1
(2): go to cabinet 2
(3): go to cabinet 3
(4): go to microwave 1
(5): go to cabinet 4
(6): go to cabinet 5
(7): go to cabinet 6
(8): go to countertop 1
(9): go to coffeemachine 1
(10): go to toaster 1
(11): go to countertop 2
(12): go to sink 1
(13): go to fridge 1
(14): put faucet 1 in/on sinkbasin 1
(15): clean faucet 1 with sink 1
(16): clean faucet 1 with sinkbasin 1
(17): examine faucet 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the **History Information** and determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation.
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".
6. The most appropriate action must be in the **Admissible Actions**, and we cannot generate a new action that is not in the **Admissible Actions**.

**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current step in the plan is step 4, which is to clean the tomato with the sink or basin. The current place is in front of the sink, as seen in the current observation image. In the current observation, we can see a potato in the sink, but no tomato is visible. Based on the history information, we have already picked up the tomato from the fridge and brought it to the sink, as indicated in Current State 4 and 5. The current observation shows that we have mistakenly put a potato in the sink instead of the tomato. Therefore, we need to correct this by taking the potato out of the sink and cleaning the tomato instead. However, the admissible actions do not include any actions for removing the potato or cleaning the tomato. The most recent action mentioned in the history was taking the faucet from the sink, which might have been an error since we should be cleaning the tomato, not the faucet. 

The Most Appropriate Action: (12): go to sink 1

This action will help reorient the agent towards the sink, and possibly provide an opportunity to correct the error and proceed with cleaning the tomato.
