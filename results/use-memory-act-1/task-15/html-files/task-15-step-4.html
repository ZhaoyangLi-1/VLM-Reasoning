VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to cool some mug and put it in coffeemachine. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a mug.
2. Pick up the mug.
3. Find a fridge.
4. Cool the mug with the fridge.
5. Find a coffee machine.
6. Place the cooled mug in the coffee machine.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
Current State 1:
1. Place: Unknown
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: countertop, coffee machine
4. Action: go to cabinet 1
Current State 2:
1. Place: Unknown, near a countertop and a coffee machine
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: Countertop, sink, coffee machine, cabinet 1 (previously checked), cabinet 2
4. Action: Go to cabinet 2
Current State 3:
1. Place: In front of cabinet 2
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: Cabinet 2 (closed)
4. Action: Open cabinet 2
Current State 4:
1. Place: In front of cabinet 2
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: mug
4. Action: go to cabinet 4


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to cabinet 1
(2): go to cabinet 3
(3): go to fridge 1
(4): go to countertop 1
(5): go to cabinet 5
(6): go to cabinet 6
(7): go to cabinet 7
(8): go to drawer 1
(9): go to drawer 2
(10): go to cabinet 8
(11): go to drawer 3
(12): go to cabinet 9
(13): go to cabinet 10
(14): go to drawer 4
(15): go to microwave 1
(16): go to cabinet 11
(17): go to toaster 1
(18): go to cabinet 12
(19): go to cabinet 13
(20): go to cabinet 14
(21): go to cabinet 15
(22): go to countertop 2
(23): go to coffeemachine 1
(24): go to garbagecan 1
(25): go to countertop 3
(26): go to countertop 4
(27): go to sink 1
(28): go to stoveburner 1
(29): go to stoveburner 2
(30): go to stoveburner 3
(31): go to sinkbasin 1
(32): open cabinet 4
(33): close cabinet 4

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the **History Information** and determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation.
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".
6. The most appropriate action must be in the **Admissible Actions**, and we cannot generate a new action that is not in the **Admissible Actions**.

**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: Based on the history information, we are currently still on step 1 of the plan which is to find a mug. The current observation shows us in front of a closed cabinet labeled as cabinet 4. The history indicates that we found a mug in cabinet 2, and the last action taken was to go to cabinet 4, which is not in line with the plan to pick up the mug. We need to pick up the mug from cabinet 2 to proceed to the next step. However, the admissible actions do not provide an option to pick up the mug or go back to cabinet 2. The most appropriate action would be to open cabinet 4, as this is the current position of the agent, and see if it contains a mug that we can use to continue with the plan.

The Most Appropriate Action: (32): open cabinet 4
