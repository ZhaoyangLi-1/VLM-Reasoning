VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to cool some mug and put it in coffeemachine. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a mug.
2. Pick up the mug.
3. Find a fridge.
4. Cool the mug with the fridge.
5. Find a coffee machine.
6. Place the cooled mug in the coffee machine.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
Current State 1:
1. Place: Unknown
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: countertop, coffee machine
4. Action: go to cabinet 1
Current State 2:
1. Place: Unknown, near a countertop and a coffee machine
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: Countertop, sink, coffee machine, cabinet 1 (previously checked), cabinet 2
4. Action: Go to cabinet 2


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to cabinet 1
(2): go to cabinet 3
(3): go to fridge 1
(4): go to countertop 1
(5): go to cabinet 4
(6): go to cabinet 5
(7): go to cabinet 6
(8): go to cabinet 7
(9): go to drawer 1
(10): go to drawer 2
(11): go to cabinet 8
(12): go to drawer 3
(13): go to cabinet 9
(14): go to cabinet 10
(15): go to drawer 4
(16): go to microwave 1
(17): go to cabinet 11
(18): go to toaster 1
(19): go to cabinet 12
(20): go to cabinet 13
(21): go to cabinet 14
(22): go to cabinet 15
(23): go to countertop 2
(24): go to coffeemachine 1
(25): go to garbagecan 1
(26): go to countertop 3
(27): go to countertop 4
(28): go to sink 1
(29): go to stoveburner 1
(30): go to stoveburner 2
(31): go to stoveburner 3
(32): go to sinkbasin 1
(33): open cabinet 2
(34): close cabinet 2

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the **History Information** and determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation.
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".
6. The most appropriate action must be in the **Admissible Actions**, and we cannot generate a new action that is not in the **Admissible Actions**.

**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: According to the History Information, we have already attempted to find a mug in cabinet 1 and are currently at step 1 in the plan. The current observation shows a closed cabinet, which could be cabinet 2 since it was the last mentioned action in the history. No other objects related to the task are visible in the current observation. Since we are still at step 1 of the plan and have not yet found a mug, we need to continue searching for it. The most appropriate action would be to open the cabinet we are currently in front of, presuming it is cabinet 2, to search for a mug.

The Most Appropriate Action: (33): open cabinet 2.
