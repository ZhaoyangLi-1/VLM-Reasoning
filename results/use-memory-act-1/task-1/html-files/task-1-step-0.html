VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to look at alarmclock under the desklamp. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find an alarm clock.
2. Pick up the alarm clock.
3. Locate a desklamp.
4. Turn on the desklamp.
5. Hold the alarm clock under the desklamp to look at it.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
No history.

**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to bed 1
(2): go to dresser 1
(3): go to drawer 1
(4): go to drawer 2
(5): go to drawer 3
(6): go to drawer 4
(7): go to drawer 5
(8): go to garbagecan 1
(9): go to drawer 6
(10): go to drawer 7
(11): go to drawer 8
(12): go to drawer 9
(13): go to drawer 10
(14): go to shelf 1
(15): go to shelf 2
(16): go to shelf 3
(17): go to shelf 4
(18): go to shelf 5
(19): go to shelf 6
(20): go to shelf 7

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the **History Information** and determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation.
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".
6. The most appropriate action must be in the **Admissible Actions**, and we cannot generate a new action that is not in the **Admissible Actions**.

**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are currently at the first step of the plan, which is to find an alarm clock. In the current observation, we can see a dresser with multiple drawers but no alarm clock in view. Based on common household organization, alarm clocks are often placed on top of dressers or inside drawers. The current observation does not show the entire dresser, so we cannot confirm if the alarm clock is on top of it. We should check the drawers of the dresser as the alarm clock might be inside one of them.

The Most Appropriate Action: (2): go to dresser 1
