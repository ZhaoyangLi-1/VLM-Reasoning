VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to look at alarmclock under the desklamp. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find an alarm clock.
2. Pick up the alarm clock.
3. Locate a desklamp.
4. Turn on the desklamp.
5. Hold the alarm clock under the desklamp to look at it.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.

(18): go to shelf 5
(19): go to shelf 6
(20): go to shelf 7

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the **History Information** and determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation.
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".
6. The most appropriate action must be in the **Admissible Actions**, and we cannot generate a new action that is not in the **Admissible Actions**.

VLM Response:
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are currently at the first step of the plan, which is to find an alarm clock. In the current observation, we can see a dresser with multiple drawers but no alarm clock in view. Based on common household organization, alarm clocks are often placed on top of dressers or inside drawers. The current observation does not show the entire dresser, so we cannot confirm if the alarm clock is on top of it. We should check the drawers of the dresser as the alarm clock might be inside one of them.

The Most Appropriate Action: (2): go to dresser 1

VLM Response:
Analysis: Based on the History Information, we are currently at step 1 in the plan, which is to find an alarm clock. Our current place is unspecified but likely a bedroom. In the current observation, none of the objects related to the task (alarm clock or desklamp) are visible. The desk contains a laptop, CD, keychain, credit card, and pen, but no alarm clock. Since the alarm clock is not on the dresser, it could be inside one of the drawers. Therefore, we need to continue searching for the alarm clock.

VLM Response:
Analysis: Based on the History Information, we are currently at step 1 in the plan, which is to find an alarm clock. The current place is a bedroom, which we can confirm from the previous observations. In the current observation, we can see an alarm clock on the dresser next to a desklamp and a laptop. This means we can complete step 1 of the plan with the current observation. The next step in the plan is to pick up the alarm clock. Since there is no "pick up alarm clock" action listed in the Admissible Actions, the most appropriate action to proceed with the plan is to open drawer 1, which may reveal more options or be a necessary step before picking up objects from the dresser.

VLM Response:
Analysis: Based on the History Information, we have successfully completed step 1 of the plan by finding an alarm clock and step 2 by picking it up. The Current Observation shows an alarm clock in our possession, a dresser, a desklamp, and a laptop. According to the plan, the next steps involve locating a desklamp, turning it on, and holding the alarm clock under it to look at it. Since the desklamp is already located and visible in the current observation, we can proceed to step 4, which is to turn on the desklamp. The Admissible Actions list includes "use desklamp 1" which aligns with our next step in the plan.
