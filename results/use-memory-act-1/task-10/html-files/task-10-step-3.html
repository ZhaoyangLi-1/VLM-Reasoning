VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to clean some plate and put it in countertop. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a plate.
2. Pick up the plate.
3. Find a sink or basin.
4. Clean the plate with the sink or basin.
5. Find a countertop.
6. Place the cleaned plate on the countertop.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
Current State 1:
1. Place: Unknown location near a sink
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: Plate, Sink, Cabinet
4. Action: Go to cabinet 1
Current State 2:
1. Place: In front of a wall and a partial view of a cabinet
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: Wall, partial cabinet view, cabinet 1 (previously explored), cabinet 2
4. Action: go to cabinet 2
Current State 3:
1. Place: Kitchen
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: Countertop, plate, toaster
4. Action: Go to toaster 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to cabinet 3
(2): go to cabinet 4
(3): go to cabinet 5
(4): go to microwave 1
(5): go to garbagecan 1
(6): go to countertop 1
(7): go to drawer 1
(8): go to cabinet 6
(9): go to cabinet 7
(10): go to drawer 2
(11): go to stoveburner 1
(12): go to stoveburner 2
(13): go to countertop 2
(14): go to cabinet 8
(15): go to cabinet 9
(16): go to cabinet 10
(17): go to drawer 3
(18): go to drawer 4
(19): go to stoveburner 3
(20): go to stoveburner 4
(21): go to cabinet 11
(22): go to cabinet 12
(23): go to cabinet 13
(24): go to cabinet 14
(25): go to sinkbasin 1
(26): go to sink 1
(27): go to cabinet 15
(28): go to fridge 1
(29): go to cabinet 16
(30): go to cabinet 17
(31): go to cabinet 18
(32): go to cabinet 19
(33): go to diningtable 1
(34): go to coffeemachine 1
(35): go to cabinet 20
(36): take pot 1 from toaster 1
(37): take bread 1 from toaster 1
(38): take cup 1 from toaster 1
(39): take bowl 1 from toaster 1
(40): take stoveknob 3 from toaster 1
(41): take stoveknob 2 from toaster 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the **History Information** and determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation.
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".
6. The most appropriate action must be in the **Admissible Actions**, and we cannot generate a new action that is not in the **Admissible Actions**.

**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: According to the **History Information**, the agent is currently on step 1 of the plan, which is to find a plate. The **Current Observation** shows a countertop with several items, including a plate. Since the objective of step 1 is to find a plate and there is a visible plate in the current observation, we can consider step 1 to be complete. The next step is to pick up the plate. However, there is no action listed in the **Admissible Actions** that directly indicates picking up the plate. Therefore, the most appropriate action will be the one that brings us closest to the plate for the following step. 

The Most Appropriate Action: (6): go to countertop 1

This action will bring the agent closer to the plate observed on the countertop, positioning it to potentially pick up the plate in the next sequence of actions.
