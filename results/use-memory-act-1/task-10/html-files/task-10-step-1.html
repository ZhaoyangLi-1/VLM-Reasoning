VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to clean some plate and put it in countertop. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a plate.
2. Pick up the plate.
3. Find a sink or basin.
4. Clean the plate with the sink or basin.
5. Find a countertop.
6. Place the cleaned plate on the countertop.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
Current State 1:
1. Place: Unknown location near a sink
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: Plate, Sink, Cabinet
4. Action: Go to cabinet 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to cabinet 2
(2): go to cabinet 3
(3): go to toaster 1
(4): go to cabinet 4
(5): go to cabinet 5
(6): go to microwave 1
(7): go to garbagecan 1
(8): go to countertop 1
(9): go to drawer 1
(10): go to cabinet 6
(11): go to cabinet 7
(12): go to drawer 2
(13): go to stoveburner 1
(14): go to stoveburner 2
(15): go to countertop 2
(16): go to cabinet 8
(17): go to cabinet 9
(18): go to cabinet 10
(19): go to drawer 3
(20): go to drawer 4
(21): go to stoveburner 3
(22): go to stoveburner 4
(23): go to cabinet 11
(24): go to cabinet 12
(25): go to cabinet 13
(26): go to cabinet 14
(27): go to sinkbasin 1
(28): go to sink 1
(29): go to cabinet 15
(30): go to fridge 1
(31): go to cabinet 16
(32): go to cabinet 17
(33): go to cabinet 18
(34): go to cabinet 19
(35): go to diningtable 1
(36): go to coffeemachine 1
(37): go to cabinet 20
(38): open cabinet 1
(39): close cabinet 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the **History Information** and determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation.
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".
6. The most appropriate action must be in the **Admissible Actions**, and we cannot generate a new action that is not in the **Admissible Actions**.

**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: Based on the History Information, we are currently at step 1 in the plan, which is to find a plate. The current observation shows an image of a wall and a partial view of a cabinet, but no plates are visible. Since we have previously gone to cabinet 1, and the current observation does not show any plates, we need to explore other cabinets. The most logical next step is to go to another cabinet in search of a plate.

The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to cabinet 2

**Summary Format**
1. Place: [Specify the current location]
2. Step Index in Plan: [Dispkay the current step number in the plan before taking the current action]
3. Objects: [List the objects relevant to the task]
4. Action: [Describe the most appropriate action without the "(x)" and keep the integer of the object]

Please analyze the **Context** and summarize the analysis using the **Summary Format**.
