VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to put two kettle in cabinet. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a kettle.
2. Pick up the kettle.
3. Find a cabinet.
4. Place the picked-up kettle inside the cabinet.
5. Find another kettle.
6. Pick up the kettle.
7. Return to the previously located cabinet.
8. Place the picked-up kettle inside the cabinet with the first kettle.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.

**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to countertop 1
(2): go to coffeemachine 1
(3): go to drawer 1
(4): go to sink 1
(5): go to sinkbasin 1
(6): go to cabinet 3
(7): go to garbagecan 1
(8): go to cabinet 4
(9): go to drawer 2
(10): go to fridge 1
(11): go to microwave 1
(12): go to dresser 1
(13): go to sidetable 1
(14): go to drawer 3
(15): go to drawer 4
(16): go to drawer 5
(17): go to drawer 6
(18): go to drawer 7
(19): go to drawer 8
(20): close cabinet 1
(21): put kettle 1 in/on cabinet 1
(22): examine kettle 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the **History Information** and determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation.
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".
6. The most appropriate action must be in the **Admissible Actions**, and we cannot generate a new action that is not in the **Admissible Actions**.

**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: Based on the History Information, we have completed up to step 8 of the plan, which is placing the first kettle inside the cabinet. However, there appears to be a discrepancy as the actions taken do not entirely align with the plan (e.g., putting kettle 1 in/on coffee machine 1 and sinkbasin 1). The Current Observation shows a kettle in front of the agent, which aligns with step 5 of the plan: "Find another kettle." Based on the current observation, we can proceed to step 6, which is to "Pick up the kettle." The Most Appropriate Action: (22): examine kettle 1. This action will allow us to ensure that this is indeed a kettle that we can pick up, as it seems we are possibly repeating the step of finding another kettle.

The Most Appropriate Action: (22): examine kettle 1.
