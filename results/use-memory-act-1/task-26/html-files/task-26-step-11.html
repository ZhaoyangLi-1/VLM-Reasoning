VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to put two kettle in cabinet. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a kettle.
2. Pick up the kettle.
3. Find a cabinet.
4. Place the picked-up kettle inside the cabinet.
5. Find another kettle.
6. Pick up the kettle.
7. Return to the previously located cabinet.
8. Place the picked-up kettle inside the cabinet with the first kettle.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.

**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to countertop 1
(2): go to coffeemachine 1
(3): go to cabinet 1
(4): go to cabinet 2
(5): go to drawer 1
(6): go to sink 1
(7): go to cabinet 3
(8): go to garbagecan 1
(9): go to cabinet 4
(10): go to drawer 2

(21): clean kettle 1 with sink 1
(22): clean kettle 1 with sinkbasin 1
(23): examine kettle 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the **History Information** and determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation.
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".
6. The most appropriate action must be in the **Admissible Actions**, and we cannot generate a new action that is not in the **Admissible Actions**.

**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: According to the History Information, the last action taken was to put kettle 1 in/on sinkbasin 1, which corresponds to step 5 of the plan. The agent is currently at the countertop near the sink, as indicated by Current State 11. The current observation shows kettle 1 on the countertop near the sink, which is the object we need to pick up according to step 6 of the plan. However, the plan requires us to find another kettle, not the one we have just placed. Therefore, we need to locate a second kettle. The admissible actions do not list an action for picking up a second kettle, so the next logical step is to find the location of another kettle. Action (23): examine kettle 1 is the only action related to the kettle, but it does not progress the plan as we need to find another kettle, not examine the one we already placed. The most appropriate action would be to go to a location where a kettle might be found. Since cabinet 2 was already interacted with for placing the first kettle, it is logical to check another cabinet.

The Most Appropriate Action: (4): go to cabinet 2
