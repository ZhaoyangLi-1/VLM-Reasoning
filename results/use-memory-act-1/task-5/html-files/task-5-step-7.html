VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to put some book on armchair. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a book.
2. Pick up the book.
3. Find an armchair.
4. Place the picked-up book on the armchair.
5. Find another book.
6. Pick up the book.
7. Return to the previously located armchair.
8. Place the picked-up book on the armchair with the first book.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
Current State 1:
1. Place: Sofa area
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: Sofa, cardboard box, smartphone
4. Action: Go to armchair 1
Current State 2:

2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: Sofa, cardboard box, smartphone
4. Action: Go to drawer 1
Current State 3:
1. Place: Unknown
2. Step Index in Plan: First step
3. Objects: Sofa, side table, coffee table
4. Action: Go to sidetable 1
Current State 4:
1. Place: Not specified in the context provided
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: None observed/relevant to the current task
4. Action: Go to dresser 1
Current State 5:
1. Place: Room with Dresser
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: Dresser 1, Book 1
4. Action: Take book 1 from dresser 1
Current State 6:

Current State 7:
1. Place: In front of an armchair
2. Step Index in Plan: 4
3. Objects: Book ("The Pilot")
4. Action: Put book 1 in/on armchair 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to sofa 1
(2): go to coffeetable 1
(3): go to drawer 1
(4): go to sidetable 1
(5): go to dresser 1
(6): go to drawer 2
(7): go to drawer 3
(8): go to drawer 4
(9): go to sidetable 2
(10): go to sidetable 3
(11): use floorlamp 1
(12): examine book 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the **History Information** and determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation.
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".
6. The most appropriate action must be in the **Admissible Actions**, and we cannot generate a new action that is not in the **Admissible Actions**.

**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: According to the history information, the agent has completed step 4 of the plan by placing the first book ("The Pilot") on the armchair. The current observation shows the book on the armchair, confirming that step 4 is finished. We are now at step 5, which is to find another book. The admissible actions do not include picking up a book directly, so we need to go to a location where we can find another book. Since the history shows that the agent previously took a book from a dresser, it would make sense to check the dressers again. The current observation does not reveal any new books or locations to search for them, so we must move to a new location to progress. 

The Most Appropriate Action: (5): go to dresser 1
