**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the **History Information** and determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation.
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".
6. The most appropriate action must be in the **Admissible Actions**, and we cannot generate a new action that is not in the **Admissible Actions**.

**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: Based on the History Information, we are currently at step 8 in the plan, which is to place the second picked-up credit card on the coffee table with the first one. The current place is at the coffee table, as indicated by the last historical state and the current observation image. In the current observation, we see a remote control and an open cardboard box on the coffee table. There is no visible second credit card in the current observation, which is necessary for completing step 8. Since the second credit card is not visible and none of the admissible actions include "put second credit card on coffee table," we cannot complete step 8 at this moment. The most appropriate action should be one that potentially leads us to locate the second credit card. Since the historical states indicate that we have been to the sofa and examined it, the next logical step would be to explore other furniture items in the room where a credit card might be placed. 

The Most Appropriate Action: (13): go to sidetable 1
