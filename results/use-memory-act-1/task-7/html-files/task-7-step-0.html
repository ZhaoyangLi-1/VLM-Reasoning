VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to put some creditcard on coffeetable. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a credit card.
2. Pick up the credit card.
3. Find a coffee table.
4. Place the picked-up credit card on the coffee table.
5. Find another credit card.
6. Pick up the second credit card.
7. Return to the same coffee table.
8. Place the second picked-up credit card on the coffee table with the first one.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
No history.

**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to armchair 1
(2): go to armchair 2
(3): go to dresser 1
(4): go to garbagecan 1
(5): go to cabinet 1
(6): go to drawer 1
(7): go to drawer 2
(8): go to cabinet 2
(9): go to drawer 3
(10): go to cabinet 3
(11): go to drawer 4
(12): go to cabinet 4
(13): go to coffeetable 1
(14): go to sidetable 1
(15): go to sofa 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the **History Information** and determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation.
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".
6. The most appropriate action must be in the **Admissible Actions**, and we cannot generate a new action that is not in the **Admissible Actions**.

**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: As there is no history information, we are at the first step of the plan, which is to find a credit card. The current observation shows two credit cards on the sofa. Since the cards are already located, we can proceed to the next step, which is to pick up the credit card. However, the admissible actions do not include an action to pick up a credit card. The most logical action to take next would be to approach the sofa where the credit cards are located. As there is no explicit "go to sofa" action in the admissible actions, we must select the closest equivalent, which in this case is "go to sofa 1".

The Most Appropriate Action: (15): go to sofa 1

The Most Appropriate Action: (15): go to sofa 1

**Summary Format**
1. Place: [Specify the current location]
2. Step Index in Plan: [Dispkay the current step number in the plan before taking the current action]
3. Objects: [List the objects relevant to the task]
4. Action: [Describe the most appropriate action without the "(x)" and keep the integer of the object]

Please analyze the **Context** and summarize the analysis using the **Summary Format**.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Summarization Response:
1. Place: Unspecified (presumably a room with a sofa)
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: Credit cards, sofa
4. Action: Go to sofa 1

-----------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Text Observation:You arrive at loc 14. On the sofa 1, you see a remotecontrol 1, and a remotecontrol 2.
