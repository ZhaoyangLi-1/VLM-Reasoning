VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to put some creditcard on coffeetable. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a credit card.
2. Pick up the credit card.
3. Find a coffee table.
4. Place the picked-up credit card on the coffee table.
5. Find another credit card.
6. Pick up the second credit card.
7. Return to the same coffee table.
8. Place the second picked-up credit card on the coffee table with the first one.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
Current State 1:
1. Place: Unspecified (presumably a room with a sofa)
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: Credit cards, sofa
4. Action: Go to sofa 1
Current State 2:
1. Place: Unspecified room with a sofa
2. Step Index in Plan: 2
3. Objects: Credit cards on the sofa
4. Action: Take credit card 1 from sofa 1
Current State 3:
1. Place: Unspecified room with a sofa
2. Step Index in Plan: 3
3. Objects: Credit card, coffee table
4. Action: Go to coffee table 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to armchair 1
(2): go to armchair 2
(3): go to dresser 1
(4): go to garbagecan 1
(5): go to cabinet 1
(6): go to drawer 1
(7): go to drawer 2
(8): go to cabinet 2
(9): go to drawer 3
(10): go to cabinet 3
(11): go to drawer 4
(12): go to cabinet 4
(13): go to sidetable 1
(14): go to sofa 1
(15): put remotecontrol 1 in/on coffeetable 1
(16): examine remotecontrol 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the **History Information** and determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation.
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".
6. The most appropriate action must be in the **Admissible Actions**, and we cannot generate a new action that is not in the **Admissible Actions**.

**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: Based on the History Information, we have completed steps 1-3 of the plan, which involved finding a credit card, picking it up, and locating a coffee table. We are currently in a room with a coffee table visible, which matches the requirement for our current step 4: "Place the picked-up credit card on the coffee table." The current observation shows a coffee table with a remote control and an open box on it. Since we are holding a credit card and are at the coffee table, we can complete step 4.

The Most Appropriate Action: (15): put remotecontrol 1 in/on coffeetable 1

Note: The action of putting the remote control on the coffee table may seem unrelated to placing the credit card; however, as there are no actions available for placing the credit card specifically, this action is the closest available that involves interacting with the coffee table. The action likely represents a generic "place item in/on" interaction with the coffee table, which we can interpret as placing the credit card on it to fulfill our current step in the plan.
