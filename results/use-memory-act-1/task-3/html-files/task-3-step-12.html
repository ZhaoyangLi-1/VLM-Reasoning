VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to examine the plate with the floorlamp. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a credit card.
2. Pick up the credit card.
3. Locate an armchair.
4. Place the picked-up credit card on the armchair.
5. Find another credit card.
6. Pick up the second credit card.
7. Return to the same armchair where the first credit card was placed.
8. Place the second credit card on the armchair beside the first credit card.
9. Find a plate.
10. Pick up the plate.
11. Locate a floorlamp.
12. Turn on the floorlamp.
13. Examine the plate under the light of the floorlamp.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
Current State 2:
1. Place: TV stand with a glass surface
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: Red credit card
4. Action: Go to coffee table 1
Current State 3:
1. Place: Coffee table 1
2. Step Index in Plan: 2
3. Objects: Credit card, plate
4. Action: Take laptop 1 from coffee table 1
Current State 5:
1. Place: Unspecified
2. Step Index in Plan: 3
3. Objects: Armchair
4. Action: Go to armchair 1
Current State 6:
1. Place: Unspecified
2. Step Index in Plan: 4
3. Objects: Credit card, laptop 1, armchair 1
4. Action: Put laptop 1 in/on armchair 1
Current State 7:
1. Place: armchair 1
2. Step Index in Plan: 5
3. Objects: None relevant to the current task
4. Action: go to coffeetable 1
Current State 9:
1. Place: armchair
2. Step Index in Plan: 5
3. Objects: None visible
4. Action: go to tvstand 1
Current State 10:
1. Place: TV stand
2. Step Index in Plan: 5
3. Objects: None visible
4. Action: Go to armchair 1
Current State 11:
1. Place: Unspecified (current observation does not match armchair 1)
2. Step Index in Plan: 5
3. Objects: None observed (no credit cards or relevant objects to the task)
4. Action: Go to shelf 1
Current State 12:
1. Place: Unspecified (observation does not match the "shelf 1" location)
2. Step Index in Plan: 5
3. Objects: None observed relevant to the task
4. Action: go to drawer 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to garbagecan 1
(2): go to tvstand 1
(3): go to shelf 2
(4): go to sofa 1
(5): go to coffeetable 1
(6): go to sidetable 1
(7): go to sidetable 2
(8): go to shelf 3
(9): go to shelf 4
(10): go to shelf 5
(11): open drawer 1
(12): close drawer 1
(13): put laptop 1 in/on drawer 1
(14): examine laptop 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the **History Information** and determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation.
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".
6. The most appropriate action must be in the **Admissible Actions**, and we cannot generate a new action that is not in the **Admissible Actions**.

**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: According to the history information, we are currently at step 5 of the plan, which is to find another credit card. The current observation does not show any credit card or relevant objects to this task. The last known action taken was "go to drawer 1," but there is no observation of a drawer in the current image, indicating the agent may not have reached the intended destination. The current place is unspecified, and no objects related to the task are visible in the current observation. Therefore, we cannot complete the current step with the current observation. The most appropriate action would be to continue searching for the second credit card by going to other locations where it might be found.

The Most Appropriate Action: (3): go to shelf 2
