VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to put a cool pan in sinkbasin. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a pan.
2. Pick up the pan.
3. Find a fridge.
4. Cool the pan with the fridge.
5. Find a sink basin.
6. Place the cool pan in the sink basin.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
Current State 1:
1. Place: Near the sink basin
2. Step Index in Plan: 1
3. Objects: Sink basin
4. Action: Go to cabinet 1
Current State 2:
1. Place: Near the sink basin
2. Step Index in Plan: Step 1
3. Objects: Pans on the stove
4. Action: Go to stoveburner 1
Current State 3:
1. Place: Stoveburner 1
2. Step Index in Plan: 2
3. Objects: Pan
4. Action: Take pot 1 from stoveburner 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to countertop 1
(2): go to cabinet 2
(3): go to countertop 2
(4): go to drawer 1
(5): go to drawer 2
(6): go to drawer 3
(7): go to drawer 4
(8): go to drawer 5
(9): go to stoveburner 2
(10): go to stoveburner 3
(11): go to stoveburner 4
(12): go to cabinet 3
(13): go to cabinet 4
(14): go to microwave 1
(15): go to cabinet 5
(16): go to cabinet 6
(17): go to cabinet 7
(18): go to sink 1
(19): go to fridge 1
(20): go to toaster 1
(21): go to coffeemachine 1
(22): go to cabinet 8
(23): go to drawer 6
(24): go to drawer 7
(25): go to drawer 8
(26): go to sinkbasin 1
(27): go to shelf 1
(28): go to shelf 2
(29): go to countertop 3
(30): go to shelf 3
(31): go to drawer 9
(32): go to cabinet 9
(33): go to garbagecan 1
(34): put pot 1 in/on stoveburner 1
(35): examine pot 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the **History Information** and determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation.
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".
6. The most appropriate action must be in the **Admissible Actions**, and we cannot generate a new action that is not in the **Admissible Actions**.

**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: According to the History Information, the AI agent has already completed steps 1 and 2 of the plan by finding a pan and picking it up. The current step in the plan is to find a fridge, which is step 3. In the current observation, the agent is in a kitchen with a visible kettle on the stove and a plant on the countertop. However, there is no fridge visible in the current observation. Therefore, the agent needs to move to a location where the fridge can be found to complete the current step.

The Most Appropriate Action: (19): go to fridge 1
