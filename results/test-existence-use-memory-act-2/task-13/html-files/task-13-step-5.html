VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to put a clean tomato in garbagecan. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a tomato.
2. Pick up the tomato.
3. Find a sink or basin.
4. Clean the tomato with the sink or basin.
5. Find a garbage can.
6. Place the cleaned tomato in the garbage can.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
State 0:
No history.
State 1:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Sink Basin, Garbage Can
3. Action: go to fridge 1
State 2:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Dark Surface (no distinguishable features)
3. Action: open fridge 1
State 3:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 2
2. Objects: Tomato, Bread, Cup
3. Action: take tomato 1 from fridge 1
State 4:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 2
2. Objects: Fridge, Tomato, Bread, Cup
3. Action: go to sinkbasin 1
State 5:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 2
2. Objects: Tomato, Sink Basin, Garbage Can
3. Action: clean tomato 1 with sinkbasin 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to countertop 1
(2): go to cabinet 1
(3): go to cabinet 2
(4): go to cabinet 3
(5): go to garbagecan 1
(6): go to cabinet 4
(7): go to toaster 1
(8): go to fridge 1
(9): go to sink 1
(10): go to cabinet 5
(11): go to microwave 1
(12): go to countertop 2
(13): go to cabinet 6
(14): go to cabinet 7
(15): go to drawer 1
(16): go to stoveburner 1
(17): go to stoveburner 2
(18): go to cabinet 8
(19): go to drawer 2
(20): go to stoveburner 3
(21): go to stoveburner 4
(22): go to coffeemachine 1
(23): go to cabinet 9
(24): go to cabinet 10
(25): go to cabinet 11
(26): go to diningtable 1
(27): go to drawer 3
(28): put tomato 1 in/on sinkbasin 1
(29): clean tomato 1 with sink 1
(30): examine tomato 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to clean the tomato with the sink or basin, which corresponds to step 4. The current place seems to be the kitchen, with a sink basin visible. In the current observation, we can see a tomato, a sink basin, and a garbage can. Based on the history information, the tomato has already been taken from the fridge and the action to clean the tomato with the sink basin has been initiated. As the tomato appears to be in front of the sink, we can infer that the cleaning action has been performed or is in the process of being performed. Therefore, the next logical step in the plan would be to find a garbage can, which we can see is also present in the current observation. Since the task stipulates that we must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished, we should verify if the tomato has been sufficiently cleaned before proceeding to the next step. However, there is no specific action listed in the admissible actions to check if the tomato is clean. The only actions related to the tomato are to put it in/on the sink basin or to clean it with the sink. Since the tomato appears to be already at the sink basin, the next appropriate action to move forward with the plan is to find a garbage can to dispose of the cleaned tomato.

The Most Appropriate Action: (5): go to garbagecan 1

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1
