VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to put a cool pan in sinkbasin. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a pan.
2. Pick up the pan.
3. Find a fridge.
4. Cool the pan with the fridge.
5. Find a sink basin.
6. Place the cooled pan in the sink basin.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.

2. Objects: Fridge (Frost Aid)
3. Action: open fridge 1
State 9:

3. Action: close fridge 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to cabinet 1
(2): go to countertop 1
(3): go to cabinet 2
(4): go to countertop 2
(5): go to drawer 1
(6): go to drawer 2
(7): go to drawer 3
(8): go to drawer 4
(9): go to stoveburner 1
(10): go to drawer 5
(11): go to stoveburner 2
(12): go to stoveburner 3

(31): go to shelf 3
(32): go to drawer 9
(33): go to cabinet 9
(34): go to garbagecan 1
(35): take nothing from fridge 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to cool the pan with the fridge, which corresponds to step 4. In the current observation, the only visible object is a fridge labeled "Frost Aid." Previous history entries show that the fridge has been interacted with multiple times (opening and closing), but there is no record of the pan being placed inside to cool it down. The history suggests that the agent is supposed to cool the pan, but the action to place the pan inside the fridge is not explicitly mentioned. Moreover, the history indicates that the fridge was opened and closed without mentioning the cooling of the pan, suggesting that the previous actions might have been incorrect within the context of the task. Since we cannot see inside the fridge at the moment, we do not have confirmation that the pan is inside and being cooled. 

Considering the above analysis and the requirement to cool the pan inside the fridge before proceeding to the next step, we are currently unable to complete step 4 based on the current observation. The admissible actions do not include anything directly related to cooling the pan, such as "place pan in fridge" or "take pan from fridge." Therefore, it appears that there is a discrepancy in the task execution, as the necessary action to cool the pan does not seem to be available. 

Since we cannot directly complete the current step with the actions provided, the best course of action might be to take an action that potentially changes the state in a way that might reveal the next correct step or prompt a more appropriate set of admissible actions. Given the history of opening and closing the fridge, and considering that we must complete each step in order, the most logical next action would be to open the fridge again to check if the pan is inside and to proceed with cooling it if it's not already being cooled.

The Most Appropriate Action: (8): go to drawer 4

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1
