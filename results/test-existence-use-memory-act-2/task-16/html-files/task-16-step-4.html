VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to put a cool pan in sinkbasin. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a pan.
2. Pick up the pan.
3. Find a fridge.
4. Cool the pan with the fridge.
5. Find a sink basin.
6. Place the cooled pan in the sink basin.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
State 0:
No history.
State 1:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Sink Basin, Faucet, Countertop
3. Action: go to cabinet 1
State 2:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 2
2. Objects: Pans, Stove
3. Action: go to stoveburner 1
State 3:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 3
2. Objects: Kettle, Stove Burner, Pot, Countertop, Sink Basin
3. Action: go to fridge 1
State 4:
Step Index in the Plan: 3
Objects: Fridge (with "Frost Aid" text)
Action: open fridge 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to cabinet 1
(2): go to countertop 1
(3): go to cabinet 2
(4): go to countertop 2
(5): go to drawer 1
(6): go to drawer 2
(7): go to drawer 3
(8): go to drawer 4
(9): go to drawer 5
(10): go to stoveburner 2
(11): go to stoveburner 3
(12): go to stoveburner 4
(13): go to cabinet 3
(14): go to cabinet 4
(15): go to microwave 1
(16): go to cabinet 5
(17): go to cabinet 6
(18): go to cabinet 7
(19): go to sink 1
(20): go to toaster 1
(21): go to coffeemachine 1
(22): go to cabinet 8
(23): go to drawer 6
(24): go to drawer 7
(25): go to drawer 8
(26): go to sinkbasin 1
(27): go to shelf 1
(28): go to shelf 2
(29): go to countertop 3
(30): go to shelf 3
(31): go to drawer 9
(32): go to cabinet 9
(33): go to garbagecan 1
(34): close fridge 1
(35): take nothing from fridge 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to cool the pan with the fridge, which correlates to step 4 of the plan. The current location of the agent is in front of an open fridge, as indicated by the current observation showing the inside of a fridge with shelves and no visible contents. The visible objects related to the task in the current observation are the fridge shelves. According to the plan and the history information, we have already found the fridge and opened it (steps 3 and 4 in the history). The next action in the plan is to cool the pan, but since there is no pan inside the fridge, we cannot complete this step with the current observation. Therefore, we cannot proceed with cooling the pan at this moment. The most appropriate action to take next is to close the fridge, as we have completed the action of opening it and there is nothing we can do inside the fridge at this stage.

The Most Appropriate Action: (34): close fridge 1

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

**Context**
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to cool the pan with the fridge, which correlates to step 4 of the plan. The current location of the agent is in front of an open fridge, as indicated by the current observation showing the inside of a fridge with shelves and no visible contents. The visible objects related to the task in the current observation are the fridge shelves. According to the plan and the history information, we have already found the fridge and opened it (steps 3 and 4 in the history). The next action in the plan is to cool the pan, but since there is no pan inside the fridge, we cannot complete this step with the current observation. Therefore, we cannot proceed with cooling the pan at this moment. The most appropriate action to take next is to close the fridge, as we have completed the action of opening it and there is nothing we can do inside the fridge at this stage.

The Most Appropriate Action: (34): close fridge 1

Please summarize the context by following above examples when providing the summary, and ensure that only the summary is included, without any extra explanation.
