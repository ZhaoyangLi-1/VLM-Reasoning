VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to look at alarmclock under the desklamp. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find an alarm clock.
2. Pick up the alarm clock.
3. Find a desk lamp.
4. Turn on the desk lamp.
5. Position the alarm clock under the desk lamp.
6. Look at the alarm clock under the light of the desk lamp.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
State 0:
No history.
State 1:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Dresser, CD, Figurine, Bookshelf, Books, Black Object (potential cup)
3. Action: go to drawer 1
State 2:
1. Step Index in the Plan: Unknown (task is to find an alarm clock)
2. Objects: Dresser, Alarm Clock, Desk Lamp, Laptop, Small Pink Object (resembling a cup), CD
3. Action: go to dresser 1
State 3:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 2
2. Objects: Dresser, Laptop, CD, Keychain, Credit Card, Alarm Clock (not visible but known to be present)
3. Action: take alarm clock 1 from dresser 1
State 4:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 3
2. Objects: Desk Lamp, Alarm Clock (previously picked up), Laptop, Dresser
3. Action: use desklamp 1
State 5:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 4
2. Objects: Desk Lamp (already turned on), Alarm Clock (picked up)
3. Action: go to bed 1
State 6:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 5
2. Objects: Bed, Pillows, Book (on the bed), Alarm Clock (in possession but not visible)
3. Action: take book 1 from bed 1
State 7:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 6
2. Objects: Bed, Pillows, Book ("The Odyssey" by Homer), Alarm Clock (in possession), Desk Lamp
3. Action: put book 1 in/on bed 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to dresser 1
(2): go to drawer 1
(3): go to drawer 2
(4): go to drawer 3
(5): go to drawer 4
(6): go to drawer 5
(7): go to garbagecan 1
(8): go to drawer 6
(9): go to drawer 7
(10): go to drawer 8
(11): go to drawer 9
(12): go to drawer 10
(13): go to shelf 1
(14): go to shelf 2
(15): go to shelf 3
(16): go to shelf 4
(17): go to shelf 5
(18): go to shelf 6
(19): go to shelf 7
(20): take book 1 from bed 1
(21): take pillow 1 from bed 1
(22): take pillow 2 from bed 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: We are currently at step 6 in the plan, which is to look at the alarm clock under the light of the desk lamp. The current observation shows us a bed with two green pillows, a blue blanket, and a book titled "The Odyssey" by Homer. The alarm clock is not visible in the current observation but based on the history, we know it is in possession. The previous action was placing the book back on the bed. Since we have already picked up the alarm clock and turned on the desk lamp in previous steps, we need to position the alarm clock under the desk lamp to proceed.

However, the current observation does not show the desk lamp, which means we are not in the correct position to complete the current step. The admissible actions list does not include any "put" action for the alarm clock or any action that directly corresponds to positioning the alarm clock under the desk lamp. Therefore, we need to navigate to a location where the desk lamp is visible so that we can then position the alarm clock under it.

Without an action to directly go to the desk lamp, we must choose the next best option. Since the last known location of the desk lamp was by the dresser, and the previous actions included using the desk lamp and going to the bed, we should consider going back to the dresser to be in the correct position to complete the task.

The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to dresser 1

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1
