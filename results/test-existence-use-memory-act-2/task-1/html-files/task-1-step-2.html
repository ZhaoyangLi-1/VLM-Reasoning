VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to look at alarmclock under the desklamp. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find an alarm clock.
2. Pick up the alarm clock.
3. Find a desk lamp.
4. Turn on the desk lamp.
5. Position the alarm clock under the desk lamp.
6. Look at the alarm clock under the light of the desk lamp.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
State 0:
No history.
State 1:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Dresser, CD, Figurine, Bookshelf, Books, Black Object (potential cup)
3. Action: go to drawer 1
State 2:
1. Step Index in the Plan: Unknown (task is to find an alarm clock)
2. Objects: Dresser, Alarm Clock, Desk Lamp, Laptop, Small Pink Object (resembling a cup), CD
3. Action: go to dresser 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to bed 1
(2): go to drawer 2
(3): go to drawer 3
(4): go to drawer 4
(5): go to drawer 5
(6): go to garbagecan 1
(7): go to drawer 6
(8): go to drawer 7
(9): go to drawer 8
(10): go to drawer 9
(11): go to drawer 10
(12): go to shelf 1
(13): go to shelf 2
(14): go to shelf 3
(15): go to shelf 4
(16): go to shelf 5
(17): go to shelf 6
(18): go to shelf 7
(19): take laptop 1 from dresser 1
(20): take cd 1 from dresser 1
(21): take keychain 2 from dresser 1
(22): take creditcard 1 from dresser 1
(23): take pen 1 from dresser 1
(24): use desklamp 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: According to the plan, the first step is to find an alarm clock. The historical data indicate that in State 2, the alarm clock was spotted on the dresser. The current observation also shows a dresser with various items on it, but the alarm clock is not directly visible in this image. Since the history confirms the alarm clock's presence on the dresser, we can infer that we are currently at Step 2 in the plan, which is to pick up the alarm clock. The objects related to the task in the current observation include the dresser, laptop, CD, keychain, and a credit card. Based on the history, the alarm clock should be on the dresser, although it is not visible from this angle. Therefore, the most appropriate action to take would be to pick up the alarm clock from the dresser.

The Most Appropriate Action: (19): take alarm clock 1 from dresser 1

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

**Context**
Analysis: According to the plan, the first step is to find an alarm clock. The historical data indicate that in State 2, the alarm clock was spotted on the dresser.
