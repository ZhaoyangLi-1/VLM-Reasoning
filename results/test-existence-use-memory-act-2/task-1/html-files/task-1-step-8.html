VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to look at alarmclock under the desklamp. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find an alarm clock.
2. Pick up the alarm clock.
3. Find a desk lamp.
4. Turn on the desk lamp.
5. Position the alarm clock under the desk lamp.
6. Look at the alarm clock under the light of the desk lamp.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

State 5:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 4
2. Objects: Desk Lamp (already turned on), Alarm Clock (picked up)

3. Action: put book 1 in/on bed 1
State 8:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 6
2. Objects: Bed, Green Pillows, Blue Blanket, Book (The Odyssey), Alarm Clock (in possession)
3. Action: go to dresser 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to bed 1
(2): go to drawer 1
(3): go to drawer 2
(4): go to drawer 3
(5): go to drawer 4
(6): go to drawer 5
(7): go to garbagecan 1
(8): go to drawer 6
(9): go to drawer 7
(10): go to drawer 8
(11): go to drawer 9
(12): go to drawer 10
(13): go to shelf 1
(14): go to shelf 2
(15): go to shelf 3
(16): go to shelf 4
(17): go to shelf 5
(18): go to shelf 6
(19): go to shelf 7
(20): take laptop 1 from dresser 1
(21): take cd 1 from dresser 1
(22): take keychain 2 from dresser 1
(23): take creditcard 1 from dresser 1
(24): take pen 1 from dresser 1
(25): use desklamp 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: Based on the history information, the agent has already located and picked up the alarm clock, found the desk lamp, turned it on, and appears to have been attempting to place the alarm clock under the desk lamp to look at it, which are steps 1 through 5. The current step in the plan seems to be step 6, which is "Look at the alarm clock under the light of the desk lamp." However, the previous actions suggest some deviation from the plan, as the agent was instructed to go to the bed and interact with a book, which is unrelated to examining the alarm clock under the desk lamp.

The current observation shows a desk with a laptop, a CD, a keychain, and a credit card visible on it. The desk lamp is partially visible on the left side of the image, which is likely the lamp we are interested in for our task. Although the alarm clock is not visible in the current observation, we know from the history that the agent has already taken the alarm clock from the dresser. Therefore, the alarm clock should be in the agent's possession.

Since the desk lamp is already turned on (step 4 completed) and the agent has the alarm clock (step 2 completed), the next logical step is to position the alarm clock under the desk lamp (step 5), which should then be followed by looking at the alarm clock under the light of the desk lamp (step 6).

The admissible actions do not include an action that directly corresponds to positioning the alarm clock under the desk lamp. However, the agent's last recorded location was at the dresser, and the current observation shows the desk area. To proceed with the task, the agent should position itself in a location where it can interact with the desk lamp and the alarm clock. Since there is no specific "position" action available and the agent is already at the dresser, the most suitable action from the list would be to use the desk lamp, which may imply positioning the alarm clock under it.

The Most Appropriate Action: (25): use desklamp 1

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1
