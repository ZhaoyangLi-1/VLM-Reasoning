VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to find two dishsponge and put them in cart. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a dish sponge.
2. Pick up the dish sponge.
3. Find a cart.
4. Place the picked-up dish sponge in the cart.
5. Find another dish sponge.
6. Pick up the dish sponge.
7. Return to the previously located cart.
8. Place the second picked-up dish sponge in the cart with the first one.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.

3. Action: go to shelf 3
State 4:
1. Step Index in the Plan: Unknown
2. Objects: Shelf, Object (cork)
3. Action: go to shelf 2
State 5:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Paper Towel Roll, Soap Bar
3. Action: go to shelf 4

Step Index in the Plan: 1
Objects: Shelf, Paper Towel Roll, Soap Bar
Action: go to bathtub 1
State 7:
1. Step Index in the Plan: Ongoing objective
2. Objects: Bathtub, Cloth, Dish Sponge
3. Action: take dishsponge 1 from bathtub 1
State 8:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 3
2. Objects: Bathtub, Dish Sponge (already picked up)
3. Action: go to cart 1
State 9:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 4
2. Objects: Cart, Green Dish Sponge
3. Action: put dishsponge 1 in/on cart 1
State 10:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 5
2. Objects: Cart, Green Dish Sponge, Black Cloth
3. Action: go to shelf 3


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to bathtub 1
(2): go to bathtubbasin 1
(3): go to toilet 1
(4): go to garbagecan 1
(5): go to toiletpaperhanger 1
(6): go to shelf 1
(7): go to shelf 2
(8): go to shelf 4
(9): go to sink 1
(10): go to sinkbasin 1
(11): go to handtowelholder 1
(12): take papertowelroll 1 from shelf 3
(13): take toiletpaper 2 from shelf 3
(14): take soapbar 2 from shelf 3

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current step in the plan is step 5, which is to find another dish sponge. The current observation shows a shelf with no dish sponge visible. The visible objects related to the task in the current observation are a paper towel roll and a soap bar. Based on the history, the agent has already retrieved a dish sponge from the bathtub and placed it in the cart. Since there is no dish sponge in the current observation, we cannot complete the current step with what is shown. Looking at the admissible actions, we should choose an action that moves us towards finding another dish sponge. The previous history indicates that the agent found a dish sponge at the bathtub. Therefore, returning to the bathtub might provide us with another dish sponge if there is more than one available there.

The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to bathtub 1

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

**Context**
Analysis: The current step in the plan is step 5, which is to find another dish sponge. The current observation shows a shelf with no dish sponge visible. The visible objects related to the task in the current observation are a paper towel roll and a soap bar.
