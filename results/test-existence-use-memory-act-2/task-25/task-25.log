VLM Response:
Analysis: The current observation shows the agent facing a bathroom mirror, with a sink visible in the reflection. Since there is no history, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a dish sponge. The visible objects related to the task are the sink and its basin, as they are common places where one might find a dish sponge. However, a dish sponge is not directly visible in the current observation. Given that we are at the beginning of the task and the dish sponge is not in sight, the agent must move to a location where a dish sponge is likely to be found. The most appropriate action would be to go to a location that is typically associated with the presence of a dish sponge, such as near the sink.

The Most Appropriate Action: (11): go to sink 1

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to find a dish sponge, which is step 1. The current place appears to be a bathroom, as indicated by the presence of a sink, mirror, and other typical bathroom objects. In the current observation, we do not see a dish sponge, which is the object required to complete the current step. Therefore, we cannot complete step 1 with the current observation. As dish sponges are not typically found in a bathroom, it would be logical to search areas where cleaning supplies or kitchen items are kept, such as shelves. The most appropriate action is to go to a shelf where a dish sponge might be located.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current observation shows a shelf with a paper towel roll and a soap bar. According to the plan, we are currently on step 1, which is to find a dish sponge. None of the objects visible in the current observation are dish sponges. Since the task requires finding a dish sponge and it is not present on the current shelf, the most appropriate next step is to continue searching for the dish sponge by moving to a different location in the environment. The admissible actions do not include picking up any item from the shelf, which confirms that the dish sponge is not among the items on this shelf. Therefore, we should move to another shelf, which could potentially hold the dish sponge.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to find a dish sponge. The current observation shows a shelf with an object that looks like a cork, which is not a dish sponge. There are no dish sponges visible in the current observation. Based on the history information, the agent has moved around to different shelves but has not yet found a dish sponge. Since no dish sponge is present on the shelf in the current observation, we must continue to search for one. None of the admissible actions directly indicate a location where a dish sponge might be found, but since we are searching the bathroom area, the most logical areas to check next might be other shelves or areas where cleaning supplies could be stored.

VLM Response:
Analysis: According to the history information and the current observation, we are still at step 1 of the plan, which is to "Find a dish sponge." The objects visible in the current observation are a paper towel roll and a soap bar. There is no dish sponge visible on the shelf. Based on the previous actions taken and the current observation, we have not yet completed step 1 of the plan because we have not found a dish sponge. Therefore, we need to continue searching for the dish sponge. Among the admissible actions, none directly relates to finding a dish sponge, but we can choose an action that allows us to continue searching in a new location. The most appropriate action would be to go to a new area where a dish sponge might be located since it is not on the current shelf.

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

**Context**
Analysis: According to the history information and the current observation, we are still at step 1 of the plan, which is to "Find a dish sponge." The objects visible in the current observation are a paper towel roll and a soap bar. There is no dish sponge visible on the shelf. Based on the previous actions taken and the current observation, we have not yet completed step 1 of the plan because we have not found a dish sponge. Therefore, we need to continue searching for the dish sponge. Among the admissible actions, none directly relates to finding a dish sponge, but we can choose an action that allows us to continue searching in a new location. The most appropriate action would be to go to a new area where a dish sponge might be located since it is not on the current shelf.

The Most Appropriate Action: (7): go to shelf 4

Please summarize the context by following above examples when providing the summary, and ensure that only the summary is included, without any extra explanation.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The agent has successfully picked up a dish sponge previously and the current step in the plan, according to the history, is step 3, which is to "Find a cart." The agent has found a cart as per the action taken in State 8 and the current image shows the interior of a cart with a green dish sponge already inside it. The green dish sponge is the object related to the task visible in the current observation. Since the agent is currently looking at the cart with the dish sponge in its possession, the next logical step is to place the dish sponge in the cart, completing step 4 of the plan.

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: Based on the history information and the current observation, the agent has already completed step 4 of the plan, which involved placing the first picked-up dish sponge in the cart. The next step in the plan is to find another dish sponge (step 5). In the current observation, we can see a cart with a green dish sponge and a black cloth inside it, but no second dish sponge is immediately visible. Since the current observation does not show another dish sponge, we cannot complete step 5 with the current observation. Therefore, the most appropriate action is to explore the environment to find another dish sponge. Looking at the admissible actions, none directly indicate the presence of a dish sponge; however, going to shelves is a reasonable choice as dish sponges could be stored there.

The Most Appropriate Action: (8): go to shelf 3

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current step in the plan is step 5, which is to find another dish sponge. The current observation shows a shelf with no dish sponge visible. The visible objects related to the task in the current observation are a paper towel roll and a soap bar. Based on the history, the agent has already retrieved a dish sponge from the bathtub and placed it in the cart. Since there is no dish sponge in the current observation, we cannot complete the current step with what is shown. Looking at the admissible actions, we should choose an action that moves us towards finding another dish sponge. The previous history indicates that the agent found a dish sponge at the bathtub. Therefore, returning to the bathtub might provide us with another dish sponge if there is more than one available there.

The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to bathtub 1
