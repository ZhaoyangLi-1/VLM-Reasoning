VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to heat some egg and put it in countertop. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find an egg.
2. Pick up the egg.
3. Find a microwave.
4. Heat the egg with the microwave.
5. Find a countertop.
6. Place the heated egg on the countertop.

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: Based on the history information, the agent has gone through various actions related to finding and picking up an egg, though it is not clear if the egg has been found and picked up yet. The current step in the plan should ideally be step 4, which is to heat the egg with the microwave if the egg has been found and picked up. However, given the history provided, it is unclear if steps 1 and 2 have been completed successfully. The current observation shows a view of a wooden cabinet with two doors, and there are no visible objects related to the task of heating an egg. Since the agent was directed to go to the microwave in the previous action (State 10), but the current observation does not include a microwave, it appears that the agent may not have reached the microwave yet. Additionally, the task of placing the heated egg on the countertop would be step 6, which we cannot proceed with until the egg heating (step 4) is complete. Therefore, the most appropriate action is to continue the effort to heat the egg by going to the microwave, assuming steps 1 and 2 were completed previously.

The Most Appropriate Action: (14): go to microwave 1

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1
