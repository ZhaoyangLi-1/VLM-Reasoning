VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to find two kettle and put them in cabinet. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a kettle.
2. Pick up the kettle.
3. Find a cabinet.
4. Place the picked-up kettle in the cabinet.
5. Find another kettle.
6. Pick up the second kettle.
7. Return to the previously found cabinet.
8. Place the second picked-up kettle in the cabinet with the first kettle.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
State 0:
No history.
State 1:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1

3. Action: go to cabinet 3
State 4:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Countertop, Kettle

State 6:
1. Step Index in the Plan: Unknown (implied step to place kettle in cabinet)
2. Objects in Observation: Countertop, Loaf of Bread, Lettuce, Apple (no cabinet visible)
3. Action: go to cabinet 1
State 7:
1. Step Index in the Plan: Between 2 and 3

3. Action: put kettle 1 in/on cabinet 1
State 8:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 5
2. Objects: Kettle, Coffeemaker, Mug
3. Action: examine kettle 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to countertop 1
(2): go to coffeemachine 1
(3): go to cabinet 2
(4): go to drawer 1
(5): go to sink 1
(6): go to sinkbasin 1
(7): go to cabinet 3
(8): go to garbagecan 1
(9): go to cabinet 4
(10): go to drawer 2
(11): go to fridge 1
(12): go to microwave 1
(13): go to dresser 1
(14): go to sidetable 1
(15): go to drawer 3
(16): go to drawer 4
(17): go to drawer 5
(18): go to drawer 6
(19): go to drawer 7
(20): go to drawer 8
(21): open cabinet 1
(22): close cabinet 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to find another kettle, which corresponds to step 5 in the detailed plan. The current place appears to be a kitchen with a countertop in view. The visible objects related to the task in the current observation include a kettle, a coffeemaker, and a mug. Based on the history and requirements for the current step, we have already found one kettle and placed it in a cabinet. To complete step 5, we need to find a second kettle, but the current observation does not display a second kettle.

Considering that we need to find another kettle and the one visible in the current observation has already been placed in a cabinet (as per the history), the most appropriate action would be to explore different places where a second kettle might be found. Since the admissible actions do not include an action to "find another kettle" directly, we will choose an action that allows us to move to a new location where a kettle might be located.

The Most Appropriate Action: (3): go to cabinet 2

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

**Context**
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to find another kettle, which corresponds to step 5 in the detailed plan. The current place appears to be a kitchen with a countertop in view. The visible objects related to the task in the current observation include a kettle, a coffeemaker, and a mug. Based on the history and requirements for the current step, we have already found one kettle and placed it in a cabinet. To complete step 5, we need to find a second kettle, but the current observation does not display a second kettle.
