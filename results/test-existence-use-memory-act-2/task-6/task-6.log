VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to put some cd on safe. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a CD.
2. Pick up the CD.
3. Find a safe.
4. Place the picked-up CD on or in the safe.
5. Find another CD.
6. Pick up the CD.
7. Return to the previously located safe.
8. Place the picked-up CD on or in the safe with the other CD.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
No history.

**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to bed 1
(2): go to dresser 1
(3): go to bed 2
(4): go to sidetable 1
(5): go to drawer 1
(6): go to drawer 2
(7): go to sidetable 2
(8): go to drawer 3
(9): go to drawer 4
(10): go to desk 1
(11): go to garbagecan 1
(12): go to drawer 5
(13): go to drawer 6
(14): go to drawer 7
(15): go to drawer 8
(16): go to drawer 9
(17): go to drawer 10
(18): go to drawer 11
(19): go to safe 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
**Analysis**: According to the plan, the first step is to find a CD. In the current observation, we see an object that resembles a CD case on the side table. There are no other visible objects related to the task in this image. Since there is no history information, we are at the beginning of the task and the current place is unknown. Based on the appearance of the object, it seems that we have located a CD case, which would allow us to complete the first step of the plan. Therefore, we should proceed to pick up the CD.

The Most Appropriate Action: (4): go to sidetable 1

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current step in the plan is step 2, which is to pick up the CD. The current place is at sidetable 1, as indicated by the previous action taken in the history information. In the current observation, we can see a sidetable with a cellphone and a credit card, but there is no CD visible. Therefore, we cannot complete the current step with the current observation since the object required (the CD) is not present. The most appropriate action to continue with the plan would be to locate and go to another place where the CD might be found, as none of the objects related to the task (CD) are visible on the sidetable.

The Most Appropriate Action: (18): go to safe 1

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current step in the plan is step 4, "Place the picked-up CD on or in the safe," because the history shows that the agent has already found a CD (step 1) and has gone to the safe (step 3). The current observation shows a CD lying on a surface next to a safe and some other objects, which means we are in the right location to complete step 4. The objects related to the task in the current observation are the CD and the safe. Based on the current observation and the requirements for the current step, we can complete the step because the CD is visible and within reach, and the safe is also present. Therefore, the agent should place the CD on or in the safe.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current step in the plan appears to be step 4, which is to place the picked-up CD on or in the safe. The current place, based on the observation, is in front of an open safe with a CD visible on the dresser surface in the foreground. The objects related to the task in the current observation are the open safe and the CD. Since the CD is visible and within reach, and the safe is open and ready to receive items, we can complete the current step with the current observation. Therefore, the most appropriate action to take is to place the CD in or on the safe.

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

Analysis: The current step in the plan appears to be step 4, which is to place the picked-up CD on or in the safe. The current place, based on the observation, is in front of an open safe with a CD visible on the dresser surface in the foreground. The objects related to the task in the current observation are the open safe and the CD. Since the CD is visible and within reach, and the safe is open and ready to receive items, we can complete the current step with the current observation. Therefore, the most appropriate action to take is to place the CD in or on the safe.
