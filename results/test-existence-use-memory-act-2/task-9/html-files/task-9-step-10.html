VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to put some soapbottle on toilet. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a soap bottle.
2. Pick up the soap bottle.
3. Find a toilet.
4. Place the picked-up soap bottle on the toilet.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
State 0:
No history.
State 1:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Sink, Faucet, Mirror, Toilet, Cabinet
3. Action: go to cabinet 1
State 2:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Sinks, Faucets, Mirror, Cabinet, Candle
3. Action: open cabinet 1
State 3:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 2
2. Objects: Sinks, Faucets, Countertop, Mirror, Candle, Cabinet 1
3. Action: take spraybottle 1 from cabinet 1
State 4:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 3
2. Objects: Soap Bottle (referred to as "spraybottle 1"), Toilet (not currently visible but known to be in the environment)
3. Action: go to toilet 1
State 5:
1. Step Index in the Plan: Unknown
2. Objects: Soap Bottle (green, referred to as "spraybottle 1"), Toilet
3. Action: put spraybottle 1 in/on toilet 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to bathtub 1
(2): go to bathtubbasin 1
(3): go to cabinet 1
(4): go to cabinet 2
(5): go to cabinet 3
(6): go to sink 1
(7): go to sink 2
(8): go to countertop 1
(9): go to cabinet 4
(10): go to sinkbasin 1
(11): go to sinkbasin 2
(12): go to toiletpaperhanger 1
(13): go to towelholder 1
(14): go to garbagecan 1
(15): go to handtowelholder 1
(16): take faucet 1 from toilet 1
(17): take scrubbrush 1 from toilet 1
(18): take plunger 1 from toilet 1
(19): take toiletpaper 1 from toilet 1
(20): take towel 1 from toilet 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to place the picked-up soap bottle on the toilet, as indicated by the history information which shows that the soap bottle (referred to as "spraybottle 1") has already been taken and the agent has gone to the toilet. In the current observation, we can see the toilet and the soap bottle which is already placed on top of the toilet tank. This indicates that the task has been completed as per the plan. There are no further actions required to complete the plan. However, since the history indicates an action to put the soap bottle in or on the toilet and the admissible actions do not include an action for confirming task completion, we should select an action that reflects the current state without altering it. Since none of the admissible actions are relevant to the current state of task completion, the most appropriate action would be a neutral one that does not affect the completed task.

The Most Appropriate Action: (20): take towel 1 from toilet 1

This action is chosen as a placeholder since the task is already completed, and none of the admissible actions pertain to the completion of the task.

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

**Context**
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to place the picked-up soap bottle on the toilet, as indicated by the history information which shows that the soap bottle (referred to as "spraybottle 1") has already been taken and the agent has gone to the toilet.
