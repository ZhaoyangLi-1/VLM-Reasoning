VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to put some book on armchair. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a book.
2. Pick up the book.
3. Find an armchair.
4. Place the picked-up book on the armchair.
5. Find another book.
6. Pick up the book.
7. Return to the previous armchair.
8. Place the picked-up book on the armchair with the first book.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
State 0:
No history.
State 1:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Armchair, Cardboard Box, Cell Phone
3. Action: go to coffeetable 1
State 2:
2. Step Index in the Plan: 2
3. Objects: Coffee Table, Books
3. Action: take book 1 from coffeetable 1
State 3:
Step Index in the Plan: 3
Objects: Sofa, Coffee Table, Items on Coffee Table
Action: go to armchair 1
State 4:
Step Index in the Plan: 4
Objects: Armchair, Book ("The Pilot")
Action: put book 1 in/on armchair 1
State 5:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 5
2. Objects: Armchair, Book ("The Pilot")
3. Action: go to coffeetable 1
State 6:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 5
2. Objects: Coffee Table, Items, Book (different from "The Pilot")
3. Action: examine book 1
State 7:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 6
2. Objects: Coffee Table, Book ("The Pilot"), Armchair, Other Items
3. Action: go to drawer 1
State 8:
6. Step Index in the Plan: 6
7. Objects: Coffee Table, Various Items, Book ("The Pilot"), Armchair, Other Non-book Objects
8. Action: go to drawer 1
State 9:
1. Step Index in the Plan: 6
2. Objects: Armchair, White Round Side Table, Plant, Poster, Book ("The Pilot")
3. Action: open drawer 1


**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to armchair 1
(2): go to sofa 1
(3): go to coffeetable 1
(4): go to sidetable 1
(5): go to dresser 1
(6): go to drawer 2
(7): go to drawer 3
(8): go to drawer 4
(9): go to sidetable 2
(10): go to sidetable 3
(11): close drawer 1
(12): put book 1 in/on drawer 1
(13): examine book 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current step in the plan is Step 7, which is to return to the previous armchair. The previous actions involved taking a book from the coffee table and opening a drawer, but it seems that the book has not been picked up from the drawer yet. In the current observation, we can see the armchair, a white round side table, a plant, a poster, and a book on the floor titled "The Pilot." This book on the floor is the same book that was placed on the armchair in Step 4, as indicated in the history. Since the task at hand is to pick up another book and we have not completed Step 6 (picking up the second book), we cannot proceed to Step 7. Therefore, we should look for the next book to pick up. The current observation does not show a book that is ready to be picked up; hence, we should explore other areas to find another book. Given the admissible actions, the most appropriate action would be to continue searching for another book, which may involve going to another drawer or furniture piece where a book might be located.

The Most Appropriate Action: (6): go to drawer 2

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

**Context**
Analysis: The current step in the plan is Step 7, which is to return to the previous armchair. The previous actions involved taking a book from the coffee table and opening a drawer, but it seems that the book has not been picked up from the drawer yet. In the current observation, we can see the armchair, a white round side table, a plant, a poster, and a book on the floor titled "The Pilot." This book on the floor is the same book that was placed on the armchair in Step 4, as indicated in the history. Since the task at hand is to pick up another book and we have not completed Step 6 (picking up the second book), we cannot proceed to Step 7. Therefore, we should look for the next book to pick up.

Given the admissible actions, the most appropriate action would be to continue searching for another book, which may involve going to another drawer or furniture piece where a book might be located.

The Most Appropriate Action: (6): go to drawer 2
