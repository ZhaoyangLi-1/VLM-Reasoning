VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to put some book on armchair. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a book.
2. Pick up the book.
3. Find an armchair.
4. Place the picked-up book on the armchair.
5. Find another book.
6. Pick up the book.
7. Return to the previous armchair.
8. Place the picked-up book on the armchair with the first book.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

**History Information**
Displayed are the previous observations with their corresponding actions.
No history.

**Admissible Actions**
(1): go to armchair 1
(2): go to sofa 1
(3): go to coffeetable 1
(4): go to drawer 1
(5): go to sidetable 1
(6): go to dresser 1
(7): go to drawer 2
(8): go to drawer 3
(9): go to drawer 4
(10): go to sidetable 2
(11): go to sidetable 3

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current observation shows an armchair with an open cardboard box on it and a cell phone to the right side on the cushion. We are at the first step of our plan, which is to find a book. Since there are no books visible in the current observation, we cannot complete this step with the current observation. Therefore, we must move to a location where we might find a book. The admissible actions do not specify a location that explicitly suggests the presence of books, such as a bookshelf or library. However, books can commonly be found on or in furniture pieces like side tables, coffee tables, and drawers. Since we are at the beginning of our task with no history information, and the current place is unknown, we should choose a new location to search for a book. Among the admissible actions, going to a coffee table or a side table would be the most likely places to find a book.

The Most Appropriate Action: (3): go to coffeetable 1

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1
