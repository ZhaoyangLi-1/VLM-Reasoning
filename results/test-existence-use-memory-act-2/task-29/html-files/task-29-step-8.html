VLM Prompt:
**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to find two tomato and put them in countertop. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
1. Find a tomato.
2. Pick up the tomato.
3. Find a countertop.
4. Place the picked-up tomato on the countertop.
5. Find another tomato.
6. Pick up the tomato.
7. Return to the previously located countertop.
8. Place the picked-up tomato on the countertop next to the other tomato.

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.

(39): take nothing from cabinet 1

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and current observation, and then determine our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List all visible objects related to the task in the current observation, without summarizing any as "various items."
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the history and the requirements for the current step, and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]"

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan in order and cannot skip steps when the previous ones are not finished.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. If receptacles such as drawers, cabinets, and so forth are closed in the current observation, we may try to open them.
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in the terms used.
5. We must determine and provide the single action which must be in the **Admissible Actions**.
6. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unknown".


**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.

VLM Response:
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to find another tomato, which corresponds to step 5. Considering the history information, the agent has already placed one tomato on the countertop, opened the fridge, and found no tomatoes inside, and has opened cabinet 1, which also did not contain tomatoes. The current observation shows the interior of an open cabinet with no visible contents, suggesting that the agent has just opened the cabinet (following the previous action: open cabinet 1). There are no visible objects related to the task in the current observation. Since we are looking for another tomato and it is not present in the current view, we cannot complete the current step with the current observation. The most appropriate action to take next would be to continue searching for a tomato by checking another location. Since the admissible actions include various "go to cabinet" actions, and we know that tomatoes are unlikely to be found in places like the toaster or garbage can, it would be logical to check another cabinet.

The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to cabinet 2

Summarization Prompt:
**Context**
Analysis: Since there is no history information, we are at the first step in the plan, which is to find a statue. The current place is unknown. In the current observation, we see a floorlamp next to an armchair with a small table that has a small object on it, which could potentially be the statue we are looking for. Since the plan requires us to find a statue first and it appears there might be one on the table next to the armchair, we should investigate this object to determine if it is the statue we need.
The Most Appropriate Action: (1): go to armchair 1

**Summary**
1. Step Index in the Plan: 1
2. Objects: Floorlamp, Armchair, Small Table, Small Object (potential statue)
3. Action: go to armchair 1

**Context**
Analysis: The current step in the plan is to find another tomato, which corresponds to step 5. Considering the history information, the agent has already placed one tomato on the countertop, opened the fridge, and found no tomatoes inside, and has opened cabinet 1, which also did not contain tomatoes. The current observation shows the interior of an open cabinet with no visible contents, suggesting that the agent has just opened the cabinet (following the previous action: open cabinet 1).
