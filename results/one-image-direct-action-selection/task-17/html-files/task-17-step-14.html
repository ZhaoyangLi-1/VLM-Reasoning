Original Response:
First, we need to find an object of the desired type, which is a pan. In the provided image, there is no pan visible on the countertop 1 or microwave 1, which are in the frame. Since we need to find the pan first, our action should be directed towards searching the cabinets and drawers where a pan is most likely to be stored. 

Considering the initial observation, we should start by searching the cabinets and drawers closest to the stoveburner, as this is where pans are commonly kept for easy access when cooking. 

The answer is: (5): go to cabinet 4
