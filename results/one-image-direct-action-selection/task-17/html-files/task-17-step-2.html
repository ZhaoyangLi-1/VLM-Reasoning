VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided image to identify all visible household objects, focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a cool pan in stoveburner."
2. Use the analysis of the image and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a cool pan in stoveburner"?
4. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in the image, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

Original Response:
The task is to put a cool pan in the stoveburner. The hint indicates that we need to find a pan, cool it with the fridge, and then place it on the stoveburner. Since we cannot see a pan in Image 1, we must search for it based on the Initial Observation.

Pans are usually stored in cabinets or drawers in a kitchen. Therefore, we should check the cabinets and drawers first. Since the cabinets are numbered, we can systematically go through them to find a pan. 

Starting with the lowest numbers, the most reasonable action would be to check cabinet 2 first as it is likely to be closer than higher numbered cabinets or drawers.

The answer is: (1): go to cabinet 2.
