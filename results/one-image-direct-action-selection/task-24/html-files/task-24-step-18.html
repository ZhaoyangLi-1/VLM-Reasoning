Original Response:
The task is to "put a hot tomato in fridge." The first step is to find a tomato. Looking at the image, there is no tomato visible on the countertops. Therefore, we must search the cabinets and drawers for a tomato. 

Next, we would need to heat the tomato in the microwave. However, since the task specifies that the agent does not need to use the microwave button or open the microwave to heat the object, we can ignore the step of interacting with the microwave directly.

Finally, we would need to put the hot tomato in the fridge. To do this, we would need to open the fridge, place the tomato inside, and then close the fridge.

Based on the initial observation, we know there is a fridge in the room, but we do not know where the tomato is. Therefore, the most reasonable action is to start by searching for the tomato in the cabinets and drawers.

The answer is: (1): go to cabinet 1
