Original Response:
The task description is "put a hot tomato in fridge." To complete this task, we need to find a tomato, heat it in the microwave, and then put it in the fridge.

From the initial observation, we know that there is a microwave and a fridge in the room, but the image provided does not show any tomatoes or other relevant objects for this task. Therefore, we need to search for the tomato.

Tomatoes are usually stored in cabinets or fridges in a household setting. Since we are instructed that the agent does not need to use the microwave button or open the microwave and just needs to do the action "heat the object with the microwave," we can skip the step of going to the microwave for now.

Given the options, the most reasonable action would be to search for the tomato in the fridge or cabinets. Since the fridge is specifically mentioned in the task, it is the most likely place to find a tomato.

The answer is: (33): open fridge 1.
