VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided image to identify all visible household objects, focusing on those relevant to the task description "put a hot tomato in fridge."
2. Use the analysis of the image and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a microwave, heat the object with the microwave, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the microwave button or open the microwave to heat the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "heat the object with the microwave"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "put a hot tomato in fridge"?
4. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in the image, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

Original Response:
The task description is "put a hot tomato in fridge," but there is no tomato visible in the image provided. Therefore, we must search every place based on the Initial Observation to find the object, which is a tomato.

The most reasonable action would be to start by going to a cabinet or drawer where a tomato might be stored. Since the image does not show any cabinets or drawers open, and we do not have information about the contents of each, we need to choose an action that involves searching for a tomato.

None of the answer choices mention looking for a tomato directly, so we must choose the closest action. The most reasonable place to find a tomato would likely be in a cabinet where food is stored, rather than a drawer or other appliance.

The answer is: (1): go to cabinet 2
