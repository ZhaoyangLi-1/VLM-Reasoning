Original Response:
First, we need to find a tomato, which is likely to be stored in a cabinet or fridge. The image provided does not show any household objects related to the task. Therefore, we need to search every place based on the initial observation to find the tomato. 

Once we have the tomato, we need to go to the microwave to heat it. The instruction specifies that the agent does not need to use the microwave button or open the microwave, so the action is simply "heat the object with the microwave."

After heating the tomato, we need to find the fridge to put the hot tomato inside.

Based on the initial observation, the fridge is listed as "fridge (1)," so the most reasonable action to complete the task description "put a hot tomato in fridge" would be to go to the fridge.

The answer is: (26): go to fridge 1.
