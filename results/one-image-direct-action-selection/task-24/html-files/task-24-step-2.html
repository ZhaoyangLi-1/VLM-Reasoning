Original Response:
The provided image does not show any household objects; it appears to be a close-up of a wall or a door. Since the task is to "put a hot tomato in fridge," we need to find a tomato first, which is typically stored in a fridge or sometimes in a cabinet if it's not ripe yet.

Based on the initial observation, we should first check the fridge where tomatoes are most commonly stored. 

The answer is: (34): open fridge 1. If the tomato is not there, we should then check the cabinets.
