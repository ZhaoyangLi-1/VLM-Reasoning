Original Response:
First, we need to identify the visible household objects in the image relevant to the task. We can see two spray bottles on the countertop.

Next, considering the task, we need to find the spray bottles and put them in the toilet. Since we have already located the spray bottles, the next reasonable action would be to pick up the first spray bottle.

However, the answer choices provided do not include an action for picking up an object. Therefore, we need to choose the closest action that could lead to completing the task. The most reasonable action from the choices given would be to go to the location where we need to place the spray bottles, which is the toilet.

The answer is: (11): go to toilet 1.
