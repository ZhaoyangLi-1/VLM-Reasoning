Original Response:
First, we need to identify the visible household objects in the image relevant to the task. In the image, we can see two spray bottles, one in the forefront and another reflected in the mirror on the countertop. 

Next, considering the task description "find two spraybottle and put them in toilet" and the task hint, the most reasonable action is to pick up the spray bottles and place them in the toilet. 

Based on the **Initial Observation** and the **Answer Choices** provided, the first step is to go to where the spray bottles are located, which is the countertop. 

Therefore, the answer is: (7): go to countertop 1. After reaching the countertop, the next actions would involve picking up the spray bottles and then going to the toilet to place them there. However, these actions are not listed in the provided answer choices.
