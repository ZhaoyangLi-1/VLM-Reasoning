Original Response:
First, we need to identify all visible household objects relevant to the task description "put a cool mug in coffeemachine." In the provided image, we can see a countertop with bread, a salt shaker, and a lettuce head. There is no mug visible on the countertop. 

According to the task hint, we need to find a mug, cool it with the fridge, and then put it in the coffeemachine. Since we do not see a mug on the countertop, we must search other locations based on the initial observation. 

The most logical place to find a mug would be in a cabinet or a drawer. Therefore, we should start by searching these locations. Since the image shows the countertop and not the cabinets or drawers, we need to choose an action that involves searching for the mug in a likely location.

The answer is: (1): go to cabinet 1
