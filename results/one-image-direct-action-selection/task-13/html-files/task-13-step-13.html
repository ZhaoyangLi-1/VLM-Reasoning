VLM Prompt:

<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided image to identify all visible household objects, focusing on those relevant to the task description "clean some tomato and put it in garbagecan."
2. Use the analysis of the image and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a sink or a basin, clean the object with a sink or basin, and then find the correct location to place it and put it down there. The agent does not need to use soap bottle or faucet to clean the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "clean the object with the sink or sink basin"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "clean some tomato and put it in garbagecan"?
4. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in the image, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

Original Response:
The task description is "clean some tomato and put it in garbagecan." In the image, we can see a refrigerator with a single tomato on the top shelf. According to the task hint, the agent must find the tomato, pick it up, go to a sink or sink basin, clean it, and then put it in the garbagecan.

The image shows us the inside of the fridge, so the next logical step would be to close the fridge and move towards the sink or sink basin to clean the tomato. Since the option to pick up the tomato is not provided, we'll assume that action is implicit and focus on the next required action.

Looking at the answer choices, closing the fridge (28) seems like the immediate next step before proceeding to clean the tomato. Therefore, the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description is to close the fridge and then move towards the sink or sink basin.

The answer is: (28): close fridge 1.
