VLM Prompt:

<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided image to identify all visible household objects, focusing on those relevant to the task description "cool some tomato and put it in microwave."
2. Use the analysis of the image and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "cool some tomato and put it in microwave"?
4. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in the image, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

Original Response:
The task is to cool some tomato and put it in the microwave. From the initial observation, we know there is a fridge available to cool the object. However, the image provided shows a close-up of an apple, a pan, a cup, and a bowl, none of which are tomatoes. Therefore, we need to search for a tomato in the locations mentioned in the initial observation. There are no cabinets or countertops visibly labeled, so we must search every place to find the tomato.

The answer is: search every place based on Initial Observation to find the object.
