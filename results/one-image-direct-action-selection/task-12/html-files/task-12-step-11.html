VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided image to identify all visible household objects, focusing on those relevant to the task description "clean some tomato and put it in countertop."
2. Use the analysis of the image and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a sink or a basin, clean the object with a sink or basin, and then find the correct location to place it and put it down there. The agent does not need to use soap bottle or faucet to clean the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "clean the object with the sink or sink basin"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "clean some tomato and put it in countertop"?
4. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in the image, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**

Original Response:
The task is to clean some tomato and put it on the countertop. Looking at the image, we can see a sink and a sink basin, which will be used to clean the tomato. The countertops are not visible in the image, but they are mentioned in the Initial Observation.

First, we need to find the tomato, which is likely to be in the fridge or a cabinet where food is usually stored. The image does not show any tomato, so we need to search for it based on the Initial Observation.

Once we have the tomato, the next step is to clean it, which involves going to the sink (option 12). After cleaning, we need to place the tomato on the countertop (either option 8 or 11).

Since the image does not show the tomato and we need to find it first before we can clean it, the most reasonable first action would be to go to the fridge where the tomato is likely stored.

The answer is: (13): go to fridge 1.
