VLM Prompt:
Image1:
<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided image to identify all visible household objects, focusing on those relevant to the task description "clean some tomato and put it in countertop."
2. Use the analysis of the image and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a sink or a basin, clean the object with a sink or basin, and then find the correct location to place it and put it down there. The agent does not need to use soap bottle or faucet to clean the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "clean the object with the sink or sink basin"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "clean some tomato and put it in countertop"?
4. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in the image, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you can see cabinet (1-6), microwave (1), countertop (1-2), coffeemachine (1), toaster (1), sink (1), sinkbasin (1), fridge (1)

Original Response:
First, we need to identify the tomato to clean it and put it on the countertop as described in the task. In the image provided, we can see a tomato on a shelf. There is no need to search cabinets or the fridge for a tomato as it is already visible in the image.

Next, we need to clean the tomato. The task hint specifies that the agent must take the object to a sink or basin to clean it. We do not need to use soap or a faucet, just the action of "clean the object with the sink or sink basin."

Finally, we need to place the cleaned tomato on the countertop. The image does not specify which countertop, but we can assume it is one that is near the sink for convenience.

Based on the Initial Observation, there is a sink (1) and a sink basin (1) mentioned. Since we have located the tomato and the next step is to clean it, we should go to the sink or sink basin.

The most reasonable action from the given choices would be to go to the sink or sink basin to clean the tomato. The answer is: (12): go to sink 1 or (13): go to sinkbasin 1. Since we can choose only one action, we will select the one that refers to the main object for cleaning purposes.

The answer is: (12): go to sink 1.
