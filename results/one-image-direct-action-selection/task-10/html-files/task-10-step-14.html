Original Response:
First, we need to identify all visible household objects relevant to the task "clean some plate and put it in countertop." From the image provided, we can see a pan on the stove burner, a plate with food on it, a toaster, and other miscellaneous items on the countertop. There are no visible cabinets that are open or plates inside them in the image.

Now, according to the task hint, the agent must find an object of the desired type, which in this case is a plate. Since no plate is visible in the open, the agent should search the cabinets to find one. Once the plate is found, the agent should go to the sink or sink basin to clean it. After cleaning, the agent needs to place the clean plate on the countertop.

Based on the initial observation, there are multiple cabinets to check. The most reasonable action would be to start with the cabinets closest to the sink for efficiency. 

The answer is: (1): go to cabinet 1. If no plate is found there, continue to the next closest cabinets until a plate is found, then proceed with the task of cleaning and placing it on the countertop.
