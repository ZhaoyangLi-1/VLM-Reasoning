VLM Prompt:

**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided image to identify all visible household objects, focusing on those relevant to the task description "cool some apple and put it in countertop."
2. Use the analysis of the image and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "cool some apple and put it in countertop"?
4. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in the image, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

Original Response:
First, we need to identify the objects on the countertop that are relevant to the task "cool some apple and put it in countertop." From the image provided, we can see a toaster, two wine bottles, a salt shaker, and an apple on the countertop. 

The task requires us to cool an apple. Since the image shows an apple on the countertop, we do not need to search every place based on the initial observation to find an apple. The next step would be to go to the fridge to cool the apple, as per the task hint. 

The answer is: (15): go to fridge 1.
