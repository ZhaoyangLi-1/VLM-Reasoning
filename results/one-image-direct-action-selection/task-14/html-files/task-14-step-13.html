Original Response:
First, we need to identify all visible household objects related to the task "cool some apple and put it in countertop." From the image provided, we can see a countertop, wine bottles, a toaster, a salt shaker, a fridge, and other objects on the countertop that are not clearly identifiable as apples.

Based on the initial observation, we are in a room with several household objects, including a fridge, which is relevant to our task of cooling an apple. Since we cannot see an apple in the image, we must search other places to find one. 

The task hint indicates that we do not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and we just need to perform an action that is "cool the object with the fridge." 

Considering all these points, it seems the most reasonable action in the choices provided would be to first find an apple. Since we cannot see one on the countertop, we should check the cabinets or drawers where an apple might be stored. 

From the answer choices given, we do not have an option to look inside the fridge, where one would typically cool an apple. However, we do have options to check various cabinets and drawers. 

The most logical choice would be to check the cabinets closest to the fridge and countertop, as those would be the most likely places to store an apple for easy access. Therefore, we should choose an action that involves searching in a cabinet.

Based on the initial observation, we have multiple cabinets numbered 1 to 11.

Since no exact choice seems to involve checking inside the fridge or taking an apple directly, we should choose to search in a cabinet that is near the fridge and countertop. The cabinets are numbered, but without knowing their exact position relative to the fridge, we should choose a cabinet that seems reasonable to check for an apple.

The answer is: (24): go to cabinet 11
