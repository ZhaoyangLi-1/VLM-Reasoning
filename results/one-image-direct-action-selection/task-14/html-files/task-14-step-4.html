VLM Prompt:

<image>
**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided image to identify all visible household objects, focusing on those relevant to the task description "cool some apple and put it in countertop."
2. Use the analysis of the image and the task hint "The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a fridge, cool the object with the fridge, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there. The agent does not need to use the fridge button or open the fridge to cool the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "cool the object with the fridge"." to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "cool some apple and put it in countertop"?
4. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in the image, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

Original Response:
The task requires cooling an apple and placing it on the countertop. From the image provided, we cannot see any apples or the fridge. However, based on the initial observation, we know there is a fridge in the room. 

Since the image does not show the desired object (apple), we need to search for it. The logical place to find an apple would be in the fridge or a cabinet where fruits might be stored. Once the apple is found, the agent must go to the fridge to cool the apple and then place it on the countertop.

The answer is: (17): go to fridge 1
