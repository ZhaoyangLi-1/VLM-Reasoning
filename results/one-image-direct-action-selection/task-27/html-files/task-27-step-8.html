Original Response:
The task description is to find two soap bottles and put them in the garbage can. In the image, we can see one soap bottle on the countertop next to the sink. There are no other soap bottles visible in this image. According to the initial observation, we might find another soap bottle in the drawer or other places, but for now, we can only see the one on the countertop. 

The most reasonable action from the choices provided would be to go to the countertop and pick up the visible soap bottle. Then we would need to find the second soap bottle, which could involve searching the drawers or other areas mentioned in the initial observation. Once we have both soap bottles, we would go to the garbage can to dispose of them. 

Based on the choices given, the first step would be to go to the countertop to pick up the visible soap bottle.

The answer is: (1): go to countertop 1.
