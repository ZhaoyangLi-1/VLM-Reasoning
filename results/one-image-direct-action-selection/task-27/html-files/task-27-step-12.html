Original Response:
The task is to find two soap bottles and put them in the garbage can. From the initial observation, we know there is a garbage can and a countertop in the room. In the image, we see a soap bottle on the countertop in front of the sink. There is no visible second soap bottle, but it could be in the drawer or another location not visible in the image.

Following the task hint, the most reasonable action is to first go to the location of the visible soap bottle, which is on the countertop. Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is: (1): go to countertop 1
