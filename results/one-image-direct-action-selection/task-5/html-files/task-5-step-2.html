Original Response:
The task is to "put a book in armchair," so the first step would be finding a book. The image shows an armchair, but no book is visible on it or around it. According to the initial observation, there is an armchair, a sofa, a coffee table, drawers, a side table, and a dresser in the room. Since books are typically found in drawers or on side tables, the most reasonable action would be to search these locations for a book.

(15): take book 1 from drawer 1 seems to be the logical action, as it mentions taking a book, which is the object we need for the task. However, it is unclear if there is indeed a book in drawer 1 as we do not have a visual confirmation, so we need to verify if the book is there.

Therefore, the next best action would be to examine the drawer where a book is most likely to be found before taking anything. This leads us to:

The answer is: (20): examine drawer 1.
