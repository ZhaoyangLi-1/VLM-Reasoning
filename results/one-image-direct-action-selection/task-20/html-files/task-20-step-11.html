Original Response:
The task is to "put a hot apple in garbagecan." First, we need to find an apple. Since there is no apple visible in the image, we must search the places where apples are likely to be kept based on the initial observation. Apples are usually stored in cabinets or fridges.

Looking at the answer choices, the only option related to finding an apple would be to examine the fridge. Therefore, the most reasonable action to perform next would be to examine the fridge to hopefully find an apple.

The answer is: (45): examine fridge 1.
