Original Response:
First, we need to find an apple, which is not visible in the provided image. Therefore, we need to search every place based on the Initial Observation to find the object. Since the task is to put a hot apple in the garbage can, we need to find the apple first.

The most reasonable action in the choices would be to search the cabinets and countertops where food items like apples are commonly stored. However, there is no direct mention of an apple in the answer choices. Since we need to find an apple, we should start by examining the places where it is most likely to be found, such as cabinets or countertops used for storing food.

The answer is: (1): go to cabinet 2. If the apple is not found there, we would continue searching the other cabinets and countertops.
