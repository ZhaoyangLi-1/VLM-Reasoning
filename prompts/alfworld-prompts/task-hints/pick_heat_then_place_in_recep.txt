The agent must find an object of the desired type, pick it up, go to a microwave, heat the object with the microwave, then find the correct location to place it, and put it down there.
The agent does not need to use the microwave button or open the microwave to heat the object, and the agent just needs to do action that is "heat the object with the microwave".
