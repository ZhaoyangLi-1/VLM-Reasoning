**Task**  
As an embodied AI agent, our final objective is to {task_description}. Use the plan, current observation, history, and admissible actions to determine the best action for the next step.

**Plan**
Step-by-step plan to complete the task:
{plan}

**Current Observation**
Image of the agent's current position:
<image>
Objects in The Image: {object_list}

**History Information**
Previous observations and actions:
{history}
Objects in The Image: {object_list}

**Admissible Actions**
{admissible_commands}

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Determine the current step and location from history and observation.
2. List all visible objects in the current observation.
3. Check if the current step can be completed with the visible objects.
4. Decide the most appropriate action.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The summarization of the analysis], The Most Appropriate Action: (i which is the integer.): [Selected action]".

**Notes**
1. Complete steps in order.
2. Provide a single action from the Admissible Actions.
3. If no history, we are at step one, location "Unknown."

**Answer**
Select the most suitable action using the Analysis Guideline and Notes.
