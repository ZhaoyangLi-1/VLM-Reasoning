**Task**  
Please perform as an embodied AI agent. Our final objective is to {task_description}. Below is the plan for completing the task, the current observation, alongside historical data and admissible actions for the next step. Please determine the best action for the next step!

**Initial Observation**
{ini_obs}

**Plan**
Below is a detailed step-by-step plan to complete the task.
{plan}

**Current Observation**
Displayed is an image capturing the current position of the agent.
<image>

**History Information**
Displayed is the previous state observations.
{history}

**Admissible Actions**
{admissible_commands}

**Analysis Guideline**
1. Analyze the history and determine the effect and our current step in the plan and our current place. 
2. List the objects with distinct integer related to the task in the current observation.
3. Analyze the objects in the current observation based on the requirements for the curret step and then determine if we can complete the step with the current observation.
4. Analyze and decide on the most appropriate action to take from **Admissible Actions**.
5. Summarize the analysis using the following format: "Analysis: [The Summarization of the analysis]\n The Most Appropriate Action: [Selected Action]".

**Notes**
1. We must complete each step of the plan sequentially.
2. For "Go to" actions listed as "go to xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "go to xxx 1", "go to xxx 2", ..., "go to xxx n". Select one specific action from these options instead of using "go to xxx [n]".
3. For "Open" actions listed as "open xxx [n]", interpret this as there are n distinct actions available: "open xxx 1", "open xxx 2", ..., "open xxx n".  Select one specific action from these options instead of using "open xxx [n]".
4. Pay attention to synonyms and ensure clarity in terms used.
5. If there is no history available, we are at the first step and the current place is "Unkown".
6. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Answer**
Please select the most suitable action by following the **Analysis Guideline**, keeping the above **Notes** in mind.
