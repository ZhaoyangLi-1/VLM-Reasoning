{admissible_commands}

**Analysis Guideline**
1. List all visiable objects in the current observation.
2. Determine if "{task_related_object}" is in the current observation.
3. If the current observation contains "{task_related_object}", pick it up. If it doesn't, we need to search for other locations.
4. Choose the most appropriate action from the list of admissible actions.
5. Summarize the analysis using the JSON format:
{{
    "thought":"the summarization of the analysis", 
    "action": "the most appropriate action"
}}

Please select the most suitable action by following the analysis guideline and output the summarized analysis without providing other information.
