**Instruction**
1. Analyze the provided images to identify all visible household objects and compare the difference between images (e.h. whether the object is opened or not and taken on hand or not), focusing on those relevant to the task description "{task_desc}."
2. Use the analysis of images and the task hint "{task_hint}" to answer the question: what is the most reasonable action in the choices for the task description "{task_desc}"?
3. Decide and write the answer using the template: The answer is: (i): <selected_action>, where i is the real number. If there is no desired object in images, search every place based on **Initial Observation** to find the object. And if no one is exactly correct, choose a similar answer.

**Initial Observation**
{ini_obs}

**Answer Choices**
{admissible_commands}
